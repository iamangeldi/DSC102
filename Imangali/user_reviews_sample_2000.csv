It is a Jazz quintet line up of Alto sax, guitar, piano, bass, and drums. It sounds like it was all recorded live, no studio tricks here. The more I listened to it the more it grew on me.

AA7P2NEC94K79,B0062P7ISY,J. Pappan,"[3, 3]","I had a really good run with my free home phone using the ObiTalk and Google Voice... almost three years of 100% free, reliable service. That all ends on May 15, 2014, when Google announced it will stop supporting the XMPP protocol, which is used by the ObiTalk devices. It couldn't last forever, I think I knew that.The next cheapest alternative I found was the MagicJack. They advertisement $19.95 a year, but in reality, it's $29.95 a year. If you want $19.95, you have to sign up for five years, which I wasn't about to do based on the not-so-great reviews and uncertainty of the service. With this purchase on Amazon, you get six months free, which is a great way to test the waters.Here's how my four star experience went: (skip to the bottom to get the short version)- I purchased the product through Amazon, it arrived quickly in a fairly small but irritating package which had to be cut out completely like a children's toy in Wal-Mart. No big deal.- I briefly read some instructions, which weren't great. Essentially, I just plugged in the device to a USB port on my iMac (yes, I'm using OS X 10.9) and plugged in the ethernet cable from my router (both cables are supplied by MJ). My plan was to run the MJ by itself, not dependent on a computer. If you plan to do this, you must still start by plugging it into your computer.- Nothing happened on plugging it in. Upon going to the MJ website, I discovered that every link I clicked resulted in a page not found 404 error. Great, the entire website was down. After an hour I went to bed. Not a great start.- Next morning, the website was up. I eventually found the Mac software by going to magicjack.com and then going to the FAQ. The MJ website is set up to attract new customers, not to support existing customers. I found the Mac software and installed, but it failed to find the MJ device. So I started my computer in Windows mode, and found the Windows driver package. I installed the package, and it too did not work.- So I went back to Mac OS, and this time I found a driver package labeled ""2014 magicJack PLUS"" under Mac downloads. After installing this and running the application, everything started to work. It walked me through setting up my device and selecting a phone number. I chose not to port my old number because I simply don't care about it. I also know that it's not just $10 to port, but the reviews indicate it's a huge hassle, and there's a $10 fee every year, not just during setup.- I did elect the $3 to pick my own number from a long list. About 5 minutes later my MagicJack was good to go. I unplugged it from my computer and plugged the USB cable into the supplied power adapter. My MJ runs completely on its own, 24/7. I use the phone several hours a day for work, and I've yet to have an interruption. No one complains of delays, like some other VOIP services.At this point, if this continues, I will lock in for 5 years to get the $19.99/yr plan.Short version:This is an incredibly cheap landline solution for the cost. Customer support is not good. They are set up to attract new customers, not keep current ones. Don't port a number, unless you can't live without it - you get charged $10/yr forever for this service. Expect to use some trial/error getting it up and running. Expect to hunt around on a few different websites for drivers/answers. If you can deal with this, go for it. Once I got through the pain of getting my number set up, I have been loving the MJ.Don't forget you can take this thing on the road with you, and your number travels along.  You just need an ethernet port, power adapter and your phone.Something else to remember - it isn't easy getting the MJ to service every phone jack in your house. You can do it, but you need to know what you're doing (like, digging around in the phone box on the side of your house, beware). Out of the box, this will only provide service for ONE phone. In my case, I have it plugged into my portable phone base, and I have several other portables around the house that depend on the base and don't plug into any wall jacks. This is probably the best way to go.",4.0,Replaced my free ObiTalk/Google Voice phone with this,1399507200.0,"05 8, 2014"

A29VOXYNYSHU4O,0517209772,Paul Snow,"[8, 46]","Asimov mostly gives pretty standard skeptic views of the Biblical texts.He commits all of the typical errors of such skeptics.  For example, he gives an analysis of the resurrection of Jesus as an event that rests on the witness of a few women.  Never mind that the texts of those accounts are contradictory and contradictory between the Gospels, and the one quoted by Asimov is actually missing from the earliest manuscripts.A true analysis would never draw historical conclusions from passages that are unlikely to have been part of the original texts. Any research at all would have avoided such a gaff.  Heck, my own study Bible points out that these passages are missing from the earliest manuscripts.Furthermore, Asimov's guide treats the Bible as a single book.  And yet the Bible is a collection of books written over at least 800 years by 60 or more authors.  Heck, even what books should be included are not universally understood across various groups of Christians.  Catholics include 7 more books that western protestants. See [...]Wouldn't you think that Asimov might have discussed this fact?  Should he not have presented what we understand to be historically factual, and what we understand to be mythical?  Shouldn't his analysis include the observation that even the earliest Christian Writers, such as Saint Augustine doubted the literal interpretations of Genesis?  Or that the oldest books of the collection include Job, a book with four chapters of God lecturing Job that he knows nothing about how the creation of the world was accomplished?  Such insights are completely missing from this ""guide"".And to be fair, many, many groups have used these texts for various purposes.  The very first Christians refused to join any army or police force, based on the pacifist readings of such texts as the Sermon on the Mount found in Matthew chapter 5.  The very first Baptists martyrs died demanding not just religious freedom for their own churches, but religious freedom for Muslims, Jews, and heretics (the common term in the 1600's for atheists).  And of course we have fundamentalism using the texts to oppose abortion, homosexuality, and evolution.  Does Asimov's guide give us insight into how some groups see religious freedom in the texts?  No.  Does he explain the roots of fundamentalism in the texts?  No.  Does he explain the pacifist and peace movements that arise from these texts?  No.A General Guide to the Bible ought to do some of this.  Should discuss how the texts have impacted history.  Should explain how the texts impact the present.  If you really want to understand the Bible in context, this book is useless.So what will you get if you read this ""guide""?  You will get the off the cuff observations of a cynical skeptic who (it seems) went out and bought a Bible, and dashed off many various common, unoriginal skeptic views to a few chosen passages into a very readable and engaging book.What you will not get is a researched, objective, fair, or insightful analysis of a library of religious and non religious texts that have done more to shape western thought, philosophy, and culture than any other collection of writings.  You will not get any discussion about how these texts have been understood historically.  You will not get any discussion about how these texts have driven various institutions such as the Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, the Greek Orthodox Church, State Churches, etc.  You will not get the arguments for and against religious freedom, as found in these texts.  Or those over creationism.  Or over concepts like the trinity, or baptism, or communion.Really, you just won't get much.",1.0,A Guide for Those Uninterested in Objective Analysis,1357257600.0,"01 4, 2013"

They have already broken up so I don't see that happening anytime soon.  But I'm not saying I didn't like them while they were around. They put on great live shows.

And a lot of them have gotten very little recognition, such Revielle or the Phunk Junkeez.  3rd Stike pulls this off decently, but still have gotten virtually no recognition.

A2K2CHOLEUH4RC,B0090AAOUW,Dan the Saxman,"[1, 1]","I use my Note 2 as an MP3 player (I do a one man band show and need backing tracks) and needed a backup MP3 player in case the Samsung should fail.  After searching in the $100.00 or so price range I decided to take a chance with the I9220.  For the price of a decent dedicated MP3 player I like the extra goodies that comes with a smartphone.  I knew it wouldn't be a match for the Note 2, but since I really won't be using it as a phone I wasn't interested in it's 3G and 4G limitations.All I can say is that I'm impressed.  I loaded many of my Note 2 apps from the Google Play Store, which went without a hitch.  So far, no complaints on the headphone jack either, as others have commented on.  For people having a problem I suggest getting an iPhone adapter.  Early iPhones had recessed headphone jacks, and this phone likely requires such a jack.  I modified my jacks when I had an iPhone, so they work well with this phone.  Concerning sound quality out of the headphone jack, my preliminary tests show it has better sound than the Note 2.  I didn't expect that.  I need to do further testing, so don't hold me to this.  The onboard speaker lacks bass, but the volume is good enough.  The onboard camera is pretty bad, but I'm comparing it to the Note 2.Considering I paid over 5x's the price for the Note 2, I am very happy with this phone.  Time will tell if it will hold up, but for me it's just a backup device, so unless it goes bad while stored in a suitcase, it will likely last a very long time.BTW, whoever installed the screen protector did an excellent job.  Better than any I have ever installed.  I really didn't know it was on until I used a pair of strong reading glasses.UPDATE:  I just checked the ""about phone"" section on the phone and see that I got the GT-I9500.  No where does it mention the I9220.  Also, the baseband is MTK6515.  Android version is 4.2.2.  Whatever they call it, it's working great so far.  Lightahead was the seller, fullfilled through Amazon.For a good video describing this phone check: [...] or do a YouTube search for: N9000 DEMO1  My phone (black color) matches the phone shown with the on-off on the right side.  Also, mine didn't come with the ""comprehensive Android manual"" he mentions in the video.Update 10/30/13:  I took off one star for the viewing angle.  When viewing from the front of the camera, which is how I use it as an MP3 player, it's pretty bad.  My Samsung Note 2 kills in this respect, and you can see the difference in screen quality big time in this respect.  After extensive testing I can say for sure the audio chip in this phone is better than my in my ""real"" Note 2.  This has become my primary MP3 player, with the Note 2 being used as a backup.Sorry for not reviewing the phone call capabilities, and all I can say is it does work as a phone, since I tried it with my Note 2 sim card.  In all other respects it continues to work as a dependable device.  Maybe I just got lucky and got one of the ""good ones"".",4.0,Better than expected!,1381795200.0,"10 15, 2013"

Rowling presents us with ""The Half-Blood Prince"", a story with all the lightness of a lead coffin.While it is neither as plodding nor as cartoonish as its predecessor, this is no beach book.The few light interludes focus on the pleasures and pitfalls of romance--between witches, wizards, werewolves, and part-Veelas.The overarching atmosphere, however, is one of gloom, abounding in vivid descriptions of violence, pain, torture, and general bloodletting.In spite of all this, however, this book pulls off two nearly impossible feats; making readers feel some sympathy for the vile Draco Malfoy and giving them some insight into the grief felt by the earliest readers of Dickens' ""Old Curiosity Shop"" over thedeath of Little Nell.Rowling is often accused of being derivative, and, unfortunately, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" gives those critics plenty of ammunition.

It's pretty sad that after decades of making shoes, they can't fix this PROBLEM.For reference, I'm a 155lb, mid foot/heel 'glider' that's light on my feet and have used the shoes up to now for close to 20 hrs total use on moderate to technical trail.",4.0,Initially fit a bit small but stretched after time.,1375401600.0,"08 2, 2013"

This book was so stinking charming, I was completely swept away by it. No wonder the book has climbed to the quarter finals in the romance category of the 2013 Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award. (More information: amazon.com/abna) I loved every single moment. The characters were charming, their lives were charming, the town of Saffron Sweeting was charming. It was so charming, I wanted to climb into the pages as I read and live among the characters. I wanted to walk into Grace Palmer's English cottage, ""put the kettle on"" and sit with her and tell her everything will be okay.The richness of the book reminded me a lot of Under the Tuscan Sun by Frances Mayes and the books by Peter Mayle set in Provence. If you love books set in a quirky little town with villagers that stake their claims on the story and a main character that struggles with internal conflict while falling in love with the beautiful but flawed surroundings of a town she haphazardly found her way to, then this is the book for you.Grace Palmer certainly received a punch in the stomach (not literally) in the opening pages when she learns of her husband's affair. But she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and returns to her home country of England only to find herself in the turmoil of changing times in the town of Saffron Sweeting.The people Grace meets in the town of Saffron Sweeting are all so wonderful as characters in a book. Each play a different role in Grace's life and each bring different elements to the storyline. What is so captivating about the story of this town is the mingling of two cultures. An American bio-tech firm is relocating American workers to Saffron Sweeting and the villagers who have always called Saffron Sweeting home are trying to adapt. Because Grace Palmer is the only person in town with insights into both cultures, she is quickly placed in the heart of the small town and must play the role of assistant, consultant and guide.I finished reading this book while on a weekend trip to Boston. I told everyone I saw on this trip about the book, even the passengers sitting on the plane beside me, imploring them to pick up a copy and start reading. It was that enjoyable, from cover to cover.Highly recommended. Run, don't walk. Or better yet, click.

AIFWCOS6FFYCV,B004VN09LM,Nathan Deunk,"[0, 0]","The Good:1. I didn't pay much.2. It holds the phone securely, whether in or out of the holster.3. When in the holster, it seems almost bulletproof.4. The felt on the inside was very soft and doesn't scratch the screen.5. It can slide into the holster face in or face out - although face out is much more difficult.6. It stands up and is quite stable in either orientation, which is the first time I've seen this in this type of case.7. It has a slightly rubberized belt clip with a strong spring that doesn't come off!The Bad:1. The phone jiggles EVER so slightly in the sleeve when it's not in the holster. It's still QUITE secure, but it could be annoying to some.2. Some people might have issues with the felt collecting dust, but I've been using it for 5 months in Djibouti and have had no problems.3. It doesn't protect the ends very well when you slide it out of the holster.4. While the plastic is grippy on your skin, on other surfaces it can be quite slick, so a tilted, hard, slick surface may not be the best place to put your phone.5. It has a slightly rubberized belt clip with a strong spring that doesn't come off!Conclusion: While I love the idea of the case, the sleeve didn't seem substantial enough to use without carrying around the holster, and the belt clip just gets in the way! I ended up snapping off the belt clip and doing an unconventional mod of the case. Turns out that if you take the button that holds the belt clip off and cut the felt in the middle, you can slide it in there and glue it down, which makes the holster much slimmer. However, this mod will ensure that you will never put any belt clip on it again. Good luck with your search for the perfect iPhone 4 case and thanks for reading!Update: I have used this case now for almost 5 months in the desert of Djibouti. After I snapped off the belt clip to make it smaller, it really worked well for me, providing just enough protection without feeling bulky. I highly recommend it, and it has become my favorite case for my iPhone by a large margin.

A3PV68UKJI1UVH,B002UAR8SK,K. Frazier,"[3, 3]","This netbook is great for a cheap small, very portable, tablet. Of course it's a netbook so expecting great performance, even out of the box, is just setting yourself up to be disappointed. I bought this netbook just over a month ago. I use it for school and simple things at home. It's good for research and note taking (I got MS office and I use OneNote on it). I use google chrome on it and it's pretty fast with this browser. I can't tell you how well it worked with the default RAM it came with because before I even turned it on I replaced the 1gb RAM stick with a 667mhz 2gb corsair stick I had bought that was shipped to my house the day before. I have had no problems with it, so no need to switch back. Like many other reviews for this netbook, I suggest you immediately upgrade to a 2gb stick of RAM.The design of this netbook is very nice (not as nice or as large as the t101mt, but I'll tell you why I chose this over the t101 later) and light. While it only has 2 USB ports you can get external add-ons (and if you need something that consumes power, then you'll need to get one that plugs into a wall outlet or has a battery pack). I have had no problems with the swiveling screen and while there is a long delay when using the button that changes the screen orientation, it's not difficult to use. The stylus is a bit annoying. It extends and will easily go back to it's normal position without having to make it (just hold it upwards). The 2 SD slots is a nice plus due to the lack of 3 USB ports. Not only that but one has a cover to make it semi-permanant. I assume this is done because there's not much hard drive space (only 32gb). The keyboard is difficult to type on first, but it doesn't take long to learn how to type on. because the keys are small it's very easy to ""fat-finger"" the keys when you type too fast (I do that a lot when I'm typing in my user-password and it takes it awhile to tell me that I typed in the incorrect password). I'm happy that they put a caps-lock LED indicator, and while they're not necessary, there are functions on the keyboard for num lock and scroll lock (some of the normal keys, when num lock is on, will function as a number pad). The camera is hardly worth mentioning. It's terrible. It's slow to capture and is 0.2 megapixels in picture capture mode. Though I didn't have a need for it in the first place so it's not a big con for me. The screen, while small, has a better PPI (pixels per sqaure inch) than most other netbooks. it's the same resolution as others but a smaller screen. That's one reason I chose it over the t101mt, also it's not very grainy.The touchscreen is nice, the multi touch features are mostly swiveling and resizing. I do recommend getting rid of some of asus' software like touchgate and the software dock. They're unnecessary and use quite a few resources (especially touchgate). However penwrite is useful, well, the t101mt version of penwrite is useful. I recommend going to the download page on Asus' website for the t101mt and downloading and installing its version of penwrite. that will allow you the option of getting palm rejection on every software, not just one note and a few other softwares. You do this by setting it into pen mode. Now there are a few problems I've had with it. When I have my palm rested on the screen while trying to write, it will reject everything, that includes whatever I'm trying to write with the pen (or draw).Now for overall performance in my very long review. Of course you can't expect too much, considering it's a netbook, but the intel GMA 500 is terrible, or well.. the intel GMA 500 DRIVERS are terrible. I can run video game emulators up to the graphics level of the SNES, however, when I tried playing megaman zero 1 (I'm a bit of a fan) on the visual boy advance emulator, on the second stage there is an overlay of what is supposed to be rain, however my graphics chip couldn't understand the overlay and completely omitted the game and just displayed the rain overlay which made it impossible to play. Now I tried the same emulator with the EXACT same rom (put the rom on a flash drive) and played it on my desktop and had no such problem. The emulator was also extremely slow. I've also had problems with visual clones of applications. One of which was a desktop gadget monitoring CPU usage and Memory usage. I was able to easily get rid of the clone by moving my mouse over it, forcing a reset of the sector of the screen the mouse was over. Now to increase performance, I recommend turning off windows aero and turning your graphics settings to either basic or classic (I'm using classic right now). I also recommend having it plugged in whenever possible for performance. Getting linux on here (from what I've read) is a nightmare. It mostly has to do with the linux graphics drivers for the intel GMA 500 being terrible (look up the Dell mini 10 ubuntu netbooks and search for articles relating to it not working). The reason it's terrible is that intel didn't actually make the chip, another company did and intel just puts their name on it. Now also to get it to work on linux, you have to compile your own driver so the touchscreen will work in linux. The first is a more difficult task than the second of course. I have had no problems with my after market memory. Of course with a processor operating at 1.33ghz, there are going to be programs crashing if you ask it to run too much (I had one note do that when I asked it to undo too much). The battery life is AMAZING. if I use it conservatively with low brightness settings, it lasts about 5 hours (on power saver mode). about 3 hours if I play music or video games (which is annoying if I'm playing chess with a friend).If you're going to listen to music, you should use headphones instead of the speakers. the speakers are on the underside of the netbook and also have low sound quality. Videos are a bit laggy (I get low frame rates on youtube on the lowest possible resolution) however I usually get no lag on sound (unless there's a high resource process running)the Bluetooth feature is very nice since I don't have a connector for my phone to a computer. The hard drive is slow (don't be fooled by the fact that it's an SSD) and only has 32gb (that's actually the marketed amount, there's less after formatting it to the NTFS filesystem, the true total is 29.7GB) of storage space. I don't store that many files on here and I don't have a lot of software and I only have 10gb remaining (while running piriform's CCleaner). I do highly recommend getting a high capacity SD card to store files on if you get this product. I would NOT use the online data storage asus provides, the interface for it has crashed windows explorer every time I try to set up an update with itif you have reached this far, I thank you and commend you for reading the entire review of this product.

The reason for this isthat this book teaches how to understand the strategic and positional ideas behind each opening.Without this knowledge, an opening is merely a series of meaningless moves, and the first time anopponent varies from book, one is left floundering for a plan, or some tactical solution which maynever be found. If this book is truly mastered, it is probably all a club player would ever need.But if concrete variations are desired, then it could be followed up profitably with MCO, or somesuch compilation of variations.

King,"[2, 3]","My original review can be found at: [...]The best summary of the message of Linchpin can be found on page 174:""You must become indispensable to thrive in the new economy. The best ways to do that are to be remarkable, insightful, an artist, someone bearing gifts. To lead. The worst way is to conform and become a cog in a giant system.""This is, at some level, rather obvious, of course. Seth spends a lot of time explaining the gift economy and the lizard brain and what he means by making art. And all of this is pretty good stuff. But what it all comes down to is this: If you want to succeed as an employee, as an employer, as a person, you need to stand out from the crowd by exceeding expectations and giving freely your best work, even if less will do. Hardly earth-shattering stuff, but worth repeating.A problem Seth has with his books is that he rarely tells you how he thinks you can achieve the very high bars he sets. Just that you need to meet them. Somehow. This is a problem that Seth himself mentions in Linchpin:""One of my favorite negative reviews of my book Tribes: 'Godin doesn't explain how to go about doing the actual hard groundwork of leadership. He makes it sound like anyone with an idea and  a cell phone can rally thousands of people to their cause in minutes if they just realize it's not hard'. My response: Telling people leadership is important is one thing. Showing them step by step precisely how to be a leader is impossible.""Linchpin works the same way. He tells you that *being indispensable* is important, and why, but stops short of telling you how. That would be impossible. Which makes Linchpin much more of a ""get off your butt and do something"" inspirational-style book than a ""here's a bunch of things you can do to make your life better"" self-help book.",3.0,"Inspirational, but obvious",1270512000.0,"04 6, 2010"

A24BYG0GAFVQJR,0141331879,Criss,"[0, 0]","""Limitele spiritului"" este volumul 5 din seria ""Academia vampirilor"", carte care mi-a placut enorm de mult. A fost plina de suspans, actiune, emotie si iubire :) Rose isi da testele de gardian, in urma carora obtine cel mai mare  punctaj. Pur si simplu este fenomenala la acest capitol - de mi-ar fi si mie la fel de simplu la examen : )Oricum, ajunsa gardian,viata ei ia cu totul si cu totul alta turnura Problemele de aceasta data sunt mult mai grave, si sa va explic de ce. Rose are un nou obiectiv: vrea sa-l faca pe Dimitri, de fapt, nu-l face, si-l readuce la starea lui initiala de dhampir. Problema e ca secretul acestei transformari este detinut de Robert, fratele maleficului Vikton Dashkov, care acum este inchis intr-o inchisoare de maxima securitate. Chiar asa, Eddie, Lissa si Rose pornesc dupa Viktor, pentru a-l elibera din Tarasov - si chiar reusesc !Esentialul este ca pentru a transforma un strigoi in dhampir este necesar ca strigoiul sa fie ucis cu o tepusa vrajita de spirit, si sa-i fie implantata in inima de acelasi utilizator al spiritului. Intorsi la Academie, Rose si ceilalti (inclusiv Adrian care li se alatura ) sunt pedepsiti. Partea asta mi s-a parut pur si simplu enervanta - cu pedeapsa - nu ca ar fi vina autoarei, insa ma enerveaza genul de personaje care arunca in stanga si-n dreapta cu acuzatii si pedepse. Daca in romanele trecute Rose era aia care ascundea chestii de Lissa, acum situatia s-a inversat, Lissa fiind mica secretoasa.Tot acest farmec ar trebui sa aibe loc pana la urmatorul atac al lui Dimitri, insa se pare ca el loveste din nou, ca strigoi, si cu toate ca Rose si Eddie au avut ocazia sa-l omoare, Rose l-a impiediat - ce sa faci cand iubesti pe cineva intratat de mult ? Ca oglindire in lumea reala, am observat sa Rose este modelul dupa care ar trebui cu totii sa ne luam - mai mult sau mai putin -. Ea nu este perfecta. Daca in primele doua carti am zis ca este prea super-eroina, apoi se intampla mai incolo sa decada intr-atat doar din cauza iubirii. Oricum ar fi, pe un grafic al evolutiei, ea devine din ce in ce mai buna, mai priceputa, mai inteligenta simai ambitioasa(daca este posibil ) . Lissa, prietena ei cea mai buna, ii este mereu alaturi, si pot spune ca mi-a placut mult de ea.Nu am avut o parere prea buna in privinta relatiei Rose- Adrian deoarece, cu toate ca el este indragostit de ea, Rose nu-l iubeste cu adevarat.""Limitele spiritului"" a fost plina de actiune, avand un titlu ideal si extrem de sugestiv. Mi-a placut ! A fost foarte buna ! Si inainte de a incheia aceasta recenzie, va mai spun ceva: Dimitri o sa atace din nou. Iar de data asta .. oare il pot salva sau va trebui sa fie ucis ? Si mai mult, oare este reala toata aceasta chestie cu salvarea sau doar isi risca vietile personajele in mod iinutil ?",5.0,A wonderful book !,1357776000.0,"01 10, 2013"

Grace and Beatrice so obviously did.  This book is a brilliant illustration of how the system fails us.  (Although, I must admit, I'm not 100% convinced that Schlictmann wasn't at least partly to blame.  I think the big payoff was his ultimate motivation-and his greed was, finally, his downfall.)I also felt amazed at how Harr was able to create such excitement around every motion filed, deposition taken and objection sustained or overruled.  It was as compelling as any thriller I've ever read.  I'm no legal expert, but I can see how this book would be extremely useful to any first-year law student.  Harr's research is impeccable; he really brought the most minute legal and technical details to light in a straightforward and reasonably objective manner.In closing, while W.R. Grace and Beatrice sleazed their way through this debacle without having to admit guilt, the Woburn families affected by this tragedy can feel somewhat vindicated in that anyone who reads A CIVIL ACTION will surely be convinced that Grace and Beatrice are truly at fault.",5.0,A small victory for the people of Woburn,978480000.0,"01 3, 2001"

A350IYXKKU2LW1,0316154601,memomoment,"[0, 0]","Veteran crime novelist Michael Connelly is in fine form with ""Lost Light,"" his 2003 entry in the detective Harry Bosch series.The novel begins eight months after the Los Angeles homicide detective retired, as Bosch turns his attention to an unsolved case that still haunts him.Angella Benton was killed on her 24th birthday, in the vestibule of her own apartment building. Three days later, $2 million in cash was stolen by gunmen in a spectacular, and bloody, heist from a movie shoot overseen by the company where Benton was a lowly worker. After Bosch and his partners were pulled from the case, the new team never made any progress, and the case all but died when one of the investigators was killed and the other was paralyzed in a lunchtime shootout at a bar.Nearly as soon as Bosch starts tugging at loose threads in the four-year-old homicide, he discovers plenty of seemingly related irregularities, including the disappearance of a federal agent and the detention of a terrorism suspect. A former colleague warns Bosch to drop the Benton case, but it will take more than that -- and more than some strong-arm tactics by a secretive U.S. government task force -- to deter the detective...It's been years since I read a murder mystery, and my reintroduction to Connelly was a bit shaky at first. Although I remember having read and enjoyed one Harry Bosch novel, the writing at the start of ""Lost Light"" seemed flat. Soon enough, however, the story kicks in, and the book swept me up and took me along for the ride.Interestingly, the book seems a bit dated, and not just because Bosch is a confirmed technophobe who doesn't even own a computer, let alone know how to use one. ""Lost Light"" was written before the start of the Iraq war, and the book represents an effort by the crime novelist to wrestle with the tradeoff between civil liberty and security that has been an issue in America since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.That discussion is still relevant, but the issue seems strangely innocent and depoliticized in the context of ""Lost Light."" I noticed no mention of any political party or of the name of then-President George W. Bush. This seems remarkable given how bitter the discourse has been over him and his successor.And even though the federal government lavishes some unwanted attention on Bosch, I had trouble believing the detective was in genuine jeopardy. By contrast, Bosch seemed much more vulnerable during the parts of the book in which he attempts a reconciliation with his ex-wife.Still, this was a fun escapist read and worth the time.",4.0,Connelly weaves murderous web,1336089600.0,"05 4, 2012"

So for my chin, I had to angle it a bunch of different ways till it grabbed each hair. I also found it hurt less after a hot shower when my pores were more open.Wow...it really hurts.

A1OME2PFEMOSFQ,B0000014RF,"Michael R. Powell ""digital_picker""","[0, 0]","Two problems exist when it comes to buying a soundtrack CD for this film.  The first, as with all score CDs it seems, is to make sure you don't end up with a bootleg.  Granted, it is simply a fact of life for score collectors that some material can only be found on these ""import""/""limited edition""/""promo""/""expanded"" score CDs, but the problem with bootlegs is that in the event of an official release, it muddies the market in terms of what is worth buying, and for what price.The other issue isn't necessarily unique to this film, but is just due to the combination of rock music and score pieces found on the original Varese Sarabande CD.  The short answer when it comes to what I'd recommend for anyone wanting a ""complete"" score for this film is to buy the recently-released Intrada CD.  However, for true completists it's not that simple.  The reason I've purchased the Varese Sarabande version and not the Intrada release is because Intrada did not include the rock tracks on their CD.  It may have been a licensing issue, or simply due to limited space.  Intrada's release of the Manhunter soundtrack also featured a track by Red 7, but I suppose these are licensed differently.  I assume it might just have been a matter of focusing on the score tracks, and for anyone who is a collector of score CDs that should probably suffice.For me, the goal was to obtain a properly-mastered version of the song ""Less Than Perfect"" by Red 7, since the CD release of their album on the Renaissance label was sub-standard at best, with ""Less Than Perfect"" being particularly affected by a lack of low end and what sounds like clipping distortion throughout.  I was disappointed to find that the version on this CD is somewhat remixed, so that it doesn't begin with the pumping bass line that started off the album version, and that the bass on this CD is only marginally better than that on the Renaissance release.  It's still nice to have, but not what I was expecting.  As for the score pieces, I could take or leave them... I never saw the film, but I do like electronic music, so some of the ""synth junk"" another reviewer alluded to might be appealing.The most important point to get across is that bootlegs of this and MANY other soundtracks abound.  As someone who has spent more than 20 years working in radio, the fact that these bootlegs are often labeled as ""promo only"" to avoid detection personally offends me.  If someone offers you a ""promo"" score CD, ask yourself ""why would a promotional CD of this material be issued?""  Remember that ALL promos come from the rights holders... there are NO ""unofficial"" promos, so if they're not released by the record company who owns the rights to the score, avoid buying them.  Obviously Varese Sarabande and Intrada license material from the rights holders, but even if a release appears to be from one of those labels, it's worth checking online to see if a particular title is indeed part of that label's catalog.  There are some very skilled graphic artists involved in creating fake score CDs, so you really have to do your homework and check out EVERYTHING.  As I said before, sometimes an unofficial release is the only source for some material, but in cases where official releases have been made, you could end up spending too much on a fake CD only to potentially find the official version later, possibly for a lower price.",3.0,"Avoid bootlegs, define ""complete"" before you buy...",1320105600.0,"11 1, 2011"

A14DV5W2N1EAJJ,1416572260,Daryl Anderson,"[112, 114]","If you are a real teacher (or principal or dean) in a real school, this humane and engaging book will surprise you with its combination of practicality and idealism. It will inspire you to change things and to believe in the possibility of change.After teaching for eight years, I have spent the last three as ""the discipline guy"", Dean of Students, in a small, rural middle school. As both teacher and now as dean I have developed a deep suspicion of a certain sort of books. You know the ones: written by theoreticians or one-on-one therapists who have never had to juggle a roomful of 25 actual young human beings with not enough time, not enough resources and far too much of paperwork, testing, and ringing bells; and more and more deeply-troubled youngsters. These are the books that anxious or angry and frustrated parents bring to meetings that tell them how you should be meeting the needs of their unsuccessful or disruptive child. These books make things far worse for everyone involved.""Lost at School"" is different; and that's clear from the beginning. After a brief introduction which pulls no punches in saying ""school discipline is broken"" the book launches into a story! Every teacher I know likes a good story - and this one feels so much like real (school)-life from the beginning that it sets the hook for the rest of the book. The different thing about this story is not the characterization of the troubled and challenging kids, but of its inclusion of the realistic range of adult personalities that combine to make education what it is - and sometimes isn't. The book sets out to follow the path of a handful of youngsters and another handful of fictional teachers and administrators who are struggling with the limitations of their own range of personalities and world-views as well as the real constraints of what schools can and cannot do. It is quite eye-opening and, in my opinion, dead-on accurate.Now don't let me give the impression that this book is just another entertaining ""Up the Down Staircase"" or ""Room 222"" or even merely another inspirational ""Stand and Deliver"". ""Lost at School"" is ultimately focused on a suite of methods for understanding children who exhibit challenging behaviors in school and for working with them to help them change. The ""storyline"" serves as an opportunity to view those methods in action as used by some fictionalized but well-drawn characters.The core assumptions of Greene's approach are that behaviorally challenging youngsters (a) ""know how we want them to behave"" and (b) ""want to behave the right way"". They don't need us to keep depriving them of privileges or offering them rewards to learn these two bits.The basic premise of the book is that these youngsters lack specific thinking skills which make it difficult or impossible for them to behave in circumstances that come up too-frequently in their school lives. Much as education has come-around in the past 20 years to acknowledge that cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, must be acknowledged as part of a youngster's learning of reading or mathematics, we need to move to a similar approach with behavioral difficulties.The goal, then, for educators, parents and the students, is to identify these missing or lagging cognitive skills and help students develop them - as central parts of their education.  Greene provides an inventory which will remind educators of the sorts of rubrics we use frequently, for instance, in assessing students for attention or hyperactivity disorders. Some of these skills may well have come up in your conversations about a difficult student, e.g. ""difficulty handling transitions"". Some of them have probably been parts of conversations about students without the notion that they ought to be taught, e.g. ""difficulty considering likely outcomes or consequences of actions"". And some of them might just not have occurred to you as loci of behavioral challenges, e.g. ""difficulty taking into account situational factors that would suggest the need to adjust a plan of action"". Rarely, though, have you or I managed to systematically think about what to do with these anecdotal observations.Having worked through the assessment of lagging skills, the next task is to ""teach"" these skills. In this regard Greene shifts gears and does not provide a ""curriculum"". Instead he provides an approach - a way of communicating with behaviorally challenging youngsters that he terms ""Collaborative Problem Solving"" or CPS. Some might find this unsatisfying. I did, at first; hoping for a ""methods"" approach to teaching this as any other group of skills. But I found Greene's system ultimately satisfying and revealing instead. He gives us CPS and weaves his ongoing story of sixth-grader Joey into its explicationThe CPS approach is interesting because it sounds so simple. Greene calls it simply ""Plan B"";  distinguishing from ""Plan A"" - wherein the teacher or institution imposes its will on the student, and from ""Plan C"" in which we ""drop an expectation completely, at least temporarily"".  I have to compliment Green on boldly sticking to such a simple naming scheme instead of coming up with typical ed-psych jargon to describe his schema or its alternatives. But the real power of such a simply-named approach is that describing it reveals how much we are all rooted in bouncing between poorly-implemented versions of plans A and C as part of school discipline. The ""Plan B"" or CPS approach assumes and requires listening to and the meaningful participation of the student -- and that is revealed to be a deeply-buried skill of even the well-intentioned educators in the storyline. But it can be learned and is the key to making things work.Greene is very open to all the ways things can go awry in dealing with real kids in real school environments. He peppers the book with ""Q&A;"" sections, and sample dialogues. But central to his acknowledgement of the ""real world"" is his fictional one! He weaves in, throughout, the ongoing tale of Joey and Mrs. Woods; of the Assistant Principal who got knocked in the jaw by Joey back in chapter one; of Joey's anguished mom and even of Mr. Armstrong, the ""these kids just have to learn how to behave"" guy, whom seems so familiar to any educator. This side-story becomes in many ways a central one as all of these people move through a year of struggle and transformation.I won't tell you how it ends but will reassure you that it does end, as most school years to, not with a bang of disaster or triumph but with a deep breath and a look ahead as all the good but flawed folks involved anticipate the next year's labors. In this Greene manages to honor the motives and efforts of everyone who chooses to work in the often thankless business of education while he deftly reminds us of how much better we could and should be doing with these youngsters.",5.0,"Not the Usual ""fix my kid"" Book: Deeply Humane and Engaging",1227312000.0,"11 22, 2008"

I have to say that most books I review end with me telling you that it's a good book, but this is NOT the case this time. This is not a good book, it's a fantastic book!I consider myself pretty versed in HTML 4 Transitional code, but HTML 5 is a whole different monster. I looked at it a while back but it wasn't very mature at the time. Things have changed a bit now. There are more browsers that support it now and the support is much better. More and more websites are offering great HTML 5 content and there is some really amazing stuff I have seen it do. I just had to get my feet wet a little more.This book, the HTML5 Developer's Cookbook, is a great way to get into this new form of web programming. I really dig the whole ""cookbook"" concept, which has some well annotated and defined ""recipes"" for accomplishing different tasks. You get great directions on everything from HTML 5 basic layout, to HTML 5 forms and much much more. This book starts with some forward information on what HTML 5 is and what it is not, a little history and background. It follows with, basically, 2 sections. Practically half the book is devoted to straight HTML 5 layout, tags, element changes, forms, css and media embedding, and the second, more advanced half of the book covers a wide variety of very useful API's. Things like drag and drop support and SQL support all the way up through really advanced things like media capture and geo-location.It took me a long time to get through this book, mostly because i really wanted to try a bunch of this stuff myself and there are a lot of code examples (those recipes again).

It has a lot of recipes, and sometimes several variations of similar things (like several different stew recipes, several different beef stroganoff recipes, etc). It must have a few hundred recipes or more.  Each page has probably 4 or 5 recipes on it- it's really a LOT of recipes!! I like the variety and choice.  It appears the recipes were submitted by individuals, and I find most of the meals are more 'traditional' meals.  Many of the meals are hearty and heavy, and probably not the most health concious, but they definitely remind me of the kind of meals I grew up eating.Most of the recipes involve very little prep work, and you can just sort of throw the ingrediants in and go.  Some slow coooker cookbooks have you cook and prepare for 1 1/2 hours before you even start slow cooking- and  that sort of defeats the purpose for me.  I slow cook because I work a 9 hour day and commute 1 1/2 hours each way.  After being gone 12 hours, and getting home late, I can't always cook a full meal.  These recipes are so easy I can throw the ingrediants in the slow cooker  at 10pm at night and put the slow cooker in the refrigerator overnight.  Then, the next morning, I pull the slow cooker out of the fridge, plug it in and go to work.  Dinner is ready by the time I get home.This is a good beginner slow cooker cookbook.  It doesn't have anything in it that I would call innovative or groundbreaking, but it's a good place to start.

Starring Jeremy Sisto, it follows the life of the future Dictator of Rome from his relative obscurity to his death at the hands of his peers on the Senate floor on the Ides of March in 44BC.The story covers the highlights of Caesar's life including his exile during the rule of the cruel dictator Sulla, his patronage under the capable General Pompey, his brutal but victorious campaigns against Vercingetorix and the Gauls, and his love affair with the beautiful and scheming Egytian queen Cleopatra.  Caesar's great ambition ultimately lead to his own murder by members of the Roman Senate who fear his ascendency, but ironically bring about the rise of the Empire.There are many political complexities that are touched upon in this film that give a good idea of the kinds of power plays that lead to Caesear's rise and fall, many of them including betrayal and murder.  The film depicts the Gallic Wars in good detail and gives an understanding of the turmoil that faced the Roman Republic in its last years before the rise of the Empire.  Caesar is portrayed as a intelligent human figure who is struck down by tragedy and overcome with amibition which ultimately leads to his own death.  The irony of Caesar's murder is that it was ostensibly to preserve the Republic, but rather hastened the foundation of the Empire.

A2MRMWRVCRX1CT,1400204224,James R. V. Matichuk,"[11, 12]","My view of angels is complicated. I was raised in an evangelical home and have always believed in angels and the part they played in the biblical story; however I was taught to be suspicious of tales of modern day angelic visitations, and to doubt the lore which was built around angels, because so much of it was New Age, Mormons, or Muslim. As a child I was tucked in with a prayer that asked God to send his angels to look after me, but if anybody started talking about experiencing angels, that was a good indication that they were a heretic or they needed to up their medication.When I was in college, I attended a charismatic church which affirmed the experiential reality of a super natural God-everything God did in scripture was for today and that included angels and angelic visitations. I remember one guest speaker at our church explaining that he felt the presence of `angels in the room' by a sensation he had in his sinus cavity(yep, I kid you not). Others saw angels, or `felt them.' I did feel the reality of God's presence at that church but the lack of critical thinking about spiritual experiences was disturbing.Joel Miller has written a book on angels which deftly guides readers past the extremes of supernatural suspicion and belief in anything and everything `angelic.' Drawing generously on Biblical and patristic sources (early church theologians), he gives an account of how the early church thought and taught about angels. He asserts that `the image that forms from these sources is, I think, more exciting, more frightening, more humbling, more inspiring, and ultimately more real than our popular conceptions.(2)' Miller discusses the early church's reflections on the nature and origin of angels, their fall from grace (in the case of Satan and his demons), the ways God used angels to nurture and protect Israel, Christs victory over the demonic, the role of guardian angels in nurturing and protecting us, our participation with the angels in the worship of God, the role of angels in the eschaton.This is a lot of ground to cover for a short book (the main text of the book is 152 pages excluding footnotes and bibliography); nevertheless Miller succeeds admirably well in delineating the understanding of angels bequeathed us from the early church, even demonstrating the way our understanding of angels has developed over time. Certainly there are some aspects of early church angel-ology where I disagree or would want to parse biblical texts which deal with angels differently. But there is no denying, the tradition has a lot to teach us.  I would recommend this book for those who have an interest in angels (whether that manifests itself as an unhealthy fascination or dismissive suspicion).  Part of navigating how we are to understand something so mysterious and etheral as angels is by submitting ourselves to a biblical understanding of angels and drawing on the rich resources of theology.  Miller does both.The question that the discerning reader may have is, ""how does ancient exegesis shape our understanding of angels?"" Just because ancient Christians thought and taught something, does not necessarily make it right. This is a popular level study and does little in way of evaluating its sources. Miller simply sites church fathers he is sympathetic to(while noting theological diversity and doctrinal development).  The belief in the fall of Lucifer is found in the ancient church, but when you read Isaiah in its historic, literary context, the Biblical data doesn't seem conclusive. There seems to be mysteries here that even the ancient church does not fully untangle for us, but I am grateful for the ways in which they affirm the angels and delineate a proper understanding of them.Practically speaking, the presence of angels reminds us of the world beyond that which we apprehend with our senses. I think this a great book for sorting out what place angels should have in our theology.Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me a copy of this book (via Book sneeze) in exchange for this review.",5.0,Help!

Incredibly, it is still just about the only device designed to surf the web on tv. The Revue allows me to go to sites I wouldn't go to with a pc for fear of spam, viruses, and malware. I go to sites that allow me to watch basically anything that's on any network as I got rid of cable over a year ago. I watched season 4 of Breaking Bad on one of these sites, and am now watching Boardwalk Empire. I also watch espn3 on it, and although the quality of the stream varies, it's usually better during the day, it's better than watching on a pc. It does get buggy sometimes, won't load video, shockwave flash crashes, says can't display content, etc. I then have to unplug it for a minute and it usually solves the problem. Tonight video wouldn't load for Mets-Yankees game, unplugged for a minute and it was fine thereafter. It even allows me to listen to grooveshark music, but not mog or rdio, which is strange.

Georgie (after his older brother's abdication many years later) is to become George VI, and Johnnie, afflicted with epilepsy, is shunted away from public view as well as the company of his family, where he grows up under the care of a devoted retinue, then dies at the age of 14.Poliakoff's scripting and direction make this story fragmented and starkly cool, representing life in the royal family's many residences as claustrophobic and its members as emotionally distant from each other. Georgie is the winning center of warmth and intelligence in the film, befriending a close aid of the king's (played wonderfully by Bill Nighy) and regarding his young brother with unwavering affection. Also at the center of the film is Johnnie's devoted caretaker (Gina McKee) who struggles unfailingly to find room for him in his parents' hearts.Meanwhile, events in Europe have their inevitable impact as both king and queen succumb to the dark forces that seem ready to sweep across war-time Britain. And their cousins, the Emperor of Russia and his family, are assassinated while Britain hesitates to offer them refuge from the Bolshevik Revolution.A powerful film, without many moments of emotional release.

A1R7CX1I1WYIKY,B000VSKAI8,Amazon Customer,"[9, 9]","After spending several hundred dollars at the chiropractor's office to relieve my pinched nerve and arthritic lower back I decided to look for an inversion table.  The overall reviews led me to picking this Ironman 4000 over the Teeter inversion models and I'm very happy I did.  The Teeter models have a problem with the ankle restraints being painful and requiring an additional purchase for relief.  I stepped right on this and had no ankle pain to deal with.FIRST THE NEGATIVES.1. This sucker is heavy.  Take a friend, a dolly, or expect to drag it (as I did) should you have to pick it up.2. One of the reviews warned about the foam material it is packed with.  It is very crumbly and will get all over if you don't contain it.  Most of this problem I eliminated by picking up all the pieces and putting them in trashbags before I began assembly.3. Once assembled, the table isn't something you could use and fold up for storage once or twice a day.  Make sure you have room for it.NOW THE POSITIVES.1. As intimidating as it looked to assemble everything went together perfectly.  There was no problem identifying parts or trying to line up holes to make it go together.  The tools provided were adequate but you probably have better tools of your own.2. This bench is extremely well constructed and designed.  In today's buyer beware world I believe I have spent money wisely and expect to use this the rest of my life.3. The Ironman 4000 is very heavy and stable.  I have no worries that anyone within the 300 pound, 6 foot 5 inch limits could use this and be safe.4. This isn't a miracle cure.  But if you want to stretch your spine, keep your flexibility, and even strengthen your abdominal muscles over a period of time, a few minutes a day on this machine should help your goals.This isn't a toy for your grandkids to do gymnastics on.

It was a sickening feeling that still churns my stomach. As the spanking was going on, I tried my hardest to not cry or scream or even whimper because I knew that I would get another set of beatings if I did this.

I have not yet been able to put my computer on it because my back is so sore after fighting with it all day.If you see a review that says this is ""easy"" to put together do NOT believe them!The nightmare assembly begins with none of the pieces being labelled.  That means you have to use trial an error to try to figure out what is what.  The only pieces that can be identified by logic are the small hanging shelf below the drawer, the table top, and the drawer side pieces.  Nothing else is clear until you play with it a few times.  it is not even clear which sides are the ""right"" verses ""wrong"" sides, let alone front from back and left from right.It was not until I was ready to put on the top metal bracket for the top shelf that I realized I had assembled parts of this backwards!Since the screws are not grouped and labelled, I managed to put the screws for the upper section into the drawer -- which was not obvious until I was ready for that section and my remaining screws would not fit.  Some of these parts are very similar in size so it is easy to confuse what is what, especially with the poor quality diagram on the ""instructions"" and micro type face used on the page.The only way I eventually assembled the desk was by coming back to Amazon and looking time and time again at the finished photo.  That is the ONLY way to really get it done.I should add that I am very good at furniture kits and have a lot of experience putting them together.  So it's pretty clear to me that the problem with assembly is really the lack of labeling and actual instructions.  In fact, you might do better to ditch the instructions and figure it out yourself; they are that useless.I am hoping once my computer is on the cart it will be a good piece of furniture.  Others think so and I bought this based on posted reviews.But ""easy"" to put together -- do not believe it!  this is the hardest kit I have ever attempted.  My entire body hurts from doing this.Also, because of the wierd ways the pieces go together, you cannot do this very well from a regular room or on the floor.  you need saw horses and other DYI tools and aids to help you balance clunky pieces.

A2MTUEA9UNCN50,1118608577,Alicia Webb,"[0, 0]","Chris Hadnagy's role as a distinguished figure in the Cybersecurity community is delightfully apparent in his authorship of ""Unmasking the Social Engineer"". In this second book on the art of social engineering (his topic of specialty), Hadnagy expertly analyzes Dr. Paul Ekman's lifelong work on body language. He deciphers and explains information about the various types on non-verbal communication while revealing relatable scenarios that are highly applicable to the social engineering element of cybersecurity.This book may trigger many 'ah ha' moments, especially if you are new to studying the art of body language. You will suddenly understand in far greater depth why people do the things they do with their body. You will also gain heightened awareness of how you control your own body, and how your body language might be perceived by others.As a cherry on top of it all, the book even contains a medley of helpful, illustrative photographs to help visually relay concepts in the study of body language.Similar to the concept of ethical hacking, one must learn to think like a hacker (or social engineer in this case) in order to most effectively defend against a social engineer. For example, in Chapter 7- The Human Emotional Processor, Hadnagy discusses the importance of building empathy or sadness during the process of an Amygdala hijack. He gives details of what a person might do or say in order to gain that empathy. After reading these details and letting it all sink in, the reader somehow instantly become a little less vulnerable to this sort of attack. This book is a solid proof that knowledge is power, especially in the study of nonverbal communication.I have had the personal pleasure of interviewing Chris Hadnagy two times in the past two years and have gained a world of insight into the art of social engineering by doing so.

AODKUG6FAKD2Z,1564784363,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[6, 6]","In 'Knowledge of Hell', a narrator who shares the name and biography of author Ant&oacute;nio Lobo Antunes leaves the vacation town of Quinta da Balaia and drives through the Portuguese countryside toward Lisbon, to return to his duties as a psychiatrist at Miguel Bombarda mental hospital.  Along the way, the author strives to peel away the faade of his character, to report his scattered thoughts, memories, fantasies and fears concerning his work, while describing the surrounding countryside in terms both nightmarish and threatening.  Though this character, like Antunes, was also involved in the cruel Portuguese Colonial War in Angola, and knew up-close the barbaric realities of conflict, it wasn't until his tenure began at Miguel Bombarda that he truly gained a knowledge of Hell.This was my first experience with Antunes' work, and, stylistically, it is the most difficult prose I've ever read.  Here the author switches points of view abruptly - sometimes mid-sentence - and inserts dreams and fantasies into the narrative without alerting the reader in any way.  He projects his paranoia and insecurities onto partial memories, desires, and absurd imaginary confrontations.  Sometimes he records dream-like episodes, where he is suddenly mistaken for a patient and locked away in the asylum, or he inhabits the unknowable final conversations of a suicide, but presents them all in the same unreal tempo as those thoughts that I had credited as rational.  To further complicate, he piles simile on top of simile, modifying one with another, and perhaps even another, as the sentence winds through clause after clause until I'm forced to go back and hunt for the original subject.  In the end, it is a non-linear phantasmagoria where Angola, the hospital, and Portugal, as represented by its countryside and history, all collapse into the refractory, unreliable mental process of this doctor and splatter across the page with abandon.It took more than a chapter to even accustom myself to the rhythms of Antunes' words, and even though I was eventually able to penetrate the style for its content, I would never say that the book flowed or became easier to comprehend.  It did remain consistent to itself though, but only by maintaining an aggressive concentration was I able to see the book through.  After finishing, I went back over the first chapter, and was quite surprised to see just how much more I was able to glean from it; so there is no doubt that, for me, should I ever decide to re-read the book, that I'll pick up a substantial amount of new information.But it does not take a great deal of discernment to understand that Antunes is condemning the field of psychiatry here - that, literally, the inmates are running the asylum, that psychiatry is nothing more than an advanced form of charlatanism, and that the system of the institution is ineffective, cruel, and broken.  It is the weight of the inhumanity that Antunes' alter ego in the book has experienced in that institution that has nearly fractured his own mental processes, and thus sparked a vacation, a sabbatical away from the hospital to which he is in the process of returning.So what is it exactly that Antunes is trying to accomplish with his complicated prose if his objectives are this straightforward? (As an aside, I will freely admit the possibility that there are uncounted concealed insights that I was unable to pick up on.  Yet I can't help feeling that any insights I may have missed circle back to the original proposition that no one is crazier than anyone else, no matter what their exterior behavior indicates, and that modern attempts to deal with mental illness is even more barbaric than warfare.)  About mid-way through the book, it dawned on me that if anyone were able to fully and thoroughly document the mental processes and thoughts going on in my own head at any given time, the result would also look like a tangled, incoherent mess.  Like Antunes' habit of skipping helter-skelter from subject to memory to observation to fantasy, my own thoughts often follow similar, incomprehensible patterns, even including the disassociation technique of thinking of myself in the third-person.  Of course, since I'm comfortable there, my craziness seems normal, though to anyone else it would sound certifiable.And that may be the point Antunes' is most eager to elicit with his oblique styling.  Yet since other reviewers and editorials concerning his work indicate that his technique is consistent throughout his oeuvre, then I must assume that, rather than a limited objective meant to merely enhance the points of this particular book, his methods are an exhaustive and detailed attempt to honestly describe the reality of our mental world by portraying it as it actually functions.  Thus, the difference between Antunes (at least here in 'Knowledge of Hell') and those writers trying to reveal the subconscious or detailing hallucinogenic states or even those writers like Faulkner, whose dense dreamy prose seems designed to awaken us to an idea, is that Antunes is a writer concerned with realism - with an absolute commitment to faithfully reproduce his character's interior dialogue.  His technique then is a way to illuminate that reality, like a cubist painter who tries to reveal three dimensions on a flat canvas.  To someone with little patience for such things, neither attempt is going to come off very well.After absorbing the novelty of this idea, I have to admit that I slowly began losing the edge of my interest.  Rooting around in the muck of anyone's consciousness is bound to be distasteful at best, though 'Knowledge of Hell' does not fully plumb the depths of sordidness that I often suspected it was leading me toward.  Still, it is called 'Knowledge of Hell' for a reason, and though I think Antunes legitimately discussed unpalatable subjects without exploiting them purely for emotional response, this is not a book for the squeamish.'Knowledge of Hell' was originally published in 1980, one year after the book ""The Land at the End of the World', and, by inference, might be considered as sort of a sequel - or at least a continuation of the story that began in Angola and then picks up in the Miguel Bombarda hospital.  I do still plan on reading 'The Land at the End of the World' at some time - perhaps that is indicative of the value I found in 'Knowledge of Hell' - but my enthusiasm is tempered by the emotional drag of this first acquaintance.  The overall effect is one of a severely subjective appraisal of the world in which ignorance is truly bliss, and once those who are discerning enough pierce the veil of our mutually agreed upon reality, there is little beyond it but despair and loneliness.On a lighter note, I found this Dalkey Archive Press edition first-rate and solid, and the partial listing of their catalog full of fascinating unknowns (to me).  Based on their recognition and inclusion of Antonio Lobo Antunes in their stable of writers, and the quality of their books, this looks as if their list might be worth investigating regardless of what I know about the individual authors, much the same way I'll often take a flyer on unknown authors from the NYRB imprint.

Here are some added reasons why:Some of the mothership and fighter effects are adequate to good.  Most are poor.  The beam weapons are, IMHO, very poor.  The Sheriff's step van crash was such a poor effect, they had to edit out most of it and make the footage just the briefest glimpse.Like many not so good films, much of it is depicted at night allowing the old crutch; poor to no lighting.  Frequently almost a totally dark screen.  Many or most times, it appears the audience is expected to just use their imagination since not enough light is present to see who is who, details, actions, etc.Additionally, the background music is extremely tedious.  One plus regarding sound:  At least the film maker didn't choose to try to ""enhance"" this poor film with deafening, ear bleeding sound effects.  Likewise, the director did NOT resort to having the cameraman shake the camera to add fake action to a dying film.  I kept expecting it somehow.Probably not what they intended, but the actors and actresses are frequently directed to give a ridiculous slack jawed look of surprise.  These phony expressions are so far gone, they are actually funny.Strong suggestion:  Don't pay any added money to rent or buy the movie download or the DVD.

A1HMV248RPGTIM,0393341372,LEON L CZIKOWSKY,"[3, 3]","The author seeks hope for people with severe mental illnesses and their families.  He is troubled that the deinstitutionalization of people with such illnesses such as severe schizophrenia has led to much violence.  He has found over 3,000 cases where a person with paranoid schizophrenia has committed murder.People became aware of deplorable conditions in mental hospitals with particular intensity in the 1940s and following decades.  This led to patients being removed from mental hospitals. In 1955, there were 558,000 in public mental hospitals (when the national population was 164 million).  In 2006, there were 40,000 in public mental hospitals (with a national population of 300 million).  Many of those who were deinstitutionalized found themselves as victims of violence, were incarcerated, and/or became homeless.The legal movement to close or reduce mental hospitals argued that involuntary hospitalizations were contrary to our belief in freedom.The National Mental Health Information Center estimates there are 12.8 million adult (or 5.4% of adults) with a serious mental illness. 4.7 million receive social security for their non-retardation disorder.  It is within this group that exists a subset that creates most of the problems.  England estimates that 10% of its schizophrenics created 80% of totally costs associated with schizophrenia.The author estimates there are 500,000 ""problematic"" and 50,000 ""most dangerous"" people with severe mental problems.  They live primarily in urban areas.  The crimes that often shock the public the most are often committed by people in this group.The author notes the question facing us is whether or not crazy people ""have a right to be crazy"".Guidelines state a person cannot be hospitalized against the person's will until they are a threat to themselves or to someone else.  Many families live in fear of a threatening relative, often claiming voices or God is commanding them to commit violent acts.  Yet until a violent act is attempted or occurs, outside help is not available.  Unfortunately, many people have been murdered or harmed before the help is provided.  Conversely, people whose illnesses caused them to threaten others have been killed or injured by those they threatened.In the 1950s, some conservative political groups believed that mental health treatment was part of Communist-Soviet attempts to control the minds of Americans.  Minute Women, U.S.A, compared mental health hospitalizations to the Soviet concentration camps.  The Daughters of American Revolution noted that 80% of U.S. psychologists were from foreign countries, with many of them from the Soviet Union.  Fiscal conservatives wanted to reduce mental health spending.Medicaid and Medicare passed in 1965, providing for benefits for people with mental disabilities.  State governments switched patients from state supported mental hospitals to community settings where the Federal government would pay for the costs of care through Medicaid and Medicare.Liberals criticized the warehousing of people with mental disabilities in psychiatric hospitals where they were provided with inadequate care.California responded by passing the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act that diminished mental health treatment in 1969.  The bill passed the legislature unanimously.  Supporters of the legislation believed the patients with psychiatric difficulties were able to make their own decisions as to what treatment they wanted.  It was argued that people with mental health disabilities had lower rates of violent acts than did the general population.  It was not noted that the reason for this lower rate was because many were in institutions where they could not commit violent public acts.Once California closed psychiatric hospitals, it then faced the problem that it lacked facilities to treat people who sought treatment or met the legal requirements for involuntary treatment.In 1973, California began closing many psychiatric hospitals.  Governor Ronald Reagan were not impressed that 71% of psychiatrists voted Democratic nor that several psychiatrists had stated that Reagan ally Barry Goldwater was not sane.California had 37,000 psychiatric patients institutionalized in the mid-1950s.  The deinstitutionalization of patients began under Governor Goodwin Knight, a Republican, and continued under successive Governors Edmund Brown, a Democrat, and Reagan, a Republican.  By 1973, there were under 7,000 people institutionalized as psychiatric patients during Reagan's tenure.The number of patient s involuntarily institutionalized by court order decreased by 99% in California from 1969 to 1978.  The average days of hospitalization for those who were involuntarily committed fell from 180 days to 15 days.Many of those discharged from psychiatric care became homeless.  Many lived in boarding houses in condition worse than they had when institutionalized.  Three studies concluded those discharged lived in ghetto conditions.  Many had not access to psychiatric treatment.  Many eventually entered the criminal justice system.A 1971 study of the Los Angeles homeless estimated that 30% to 50% had serious mental illness.  They were often victimized with beatings, getting robbed, and being raped.  Later studies confirmed similar results, with one study finding 79% of the homeless surveyed had at some point been in a psychiatric hospital and 74% had been arrested.  This study also found 30% were found to be ""too paranoid"" to accept psychiatric help.Psychiatric services in San Francisco County increased 99% between 1980 and 1993.  Sacramento County jails reported having, in 1995, 28% of its inmates requiring psychiatric medication.  The author notes that prisons had become the largest mental health institutions.Prison presents problems for mentally ill prisoners.  Violent inmates are sometimes put off by the behavior of the mentally ill and inmates then attack the mentally ill.No Federal or state government is producing data on the number of violent crimes committed by those with severe mental illness.  It is known there are many instances where this happens.  It is also observed that an increase in managed care and outpatient services seems to lower these rates.In 1955, California had 37,500 state hospital beds, or 1 for every 352 of the state's 13.2 million.  In 2003, there were 4,275 such beds, or 1 for every 8,304 of the state's 35.5 million.A 2008 San Diego study found that homelessness was the reality for 20% of patients treated for schizophrenia and for 17% of patients treated for bipolar disorder.A 1999 California study found 20% of state prisoners and 11% of county inmates were severely mentally ill.Every California county has more people with severe mental illness in prison than in a hospital.The cost of California prison psychiatric treatments was $21 million in 1993 and $245 million in 2003.Some opinions have changed over time.  Frank Lanterman, the legislator who sponsored the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, argues the Act needs to be changed.  Ironically, a day before holding  a hearing on allowing court ordered outpatient treatment for dangerous people who refuse to take the medicine for their disorders, a psychotic person drove his 18 wheel tractor into the side of the California Capitol building.  The proposal passed and became law.Fiscal conservatives fought a movement towards providing more psychiatric services. The costs, in Los Angeles in 2004, for one day of psychiatric hospital care was $607, for prison was $85, for jail was $64, and for a public shelter was $3.  The author notes this failed to consider cost of the numerous criminal justices arrests of people with psychiatric problems.It is estimated that people with severe mental illness committed at least 4,700 homicides between 1970 and 2004 in California.In 1972, a three judge panel in the Lessard Decision created specific criteria that made it more difficult to involuntarily treat someone for a mental illness. This overturned 700 years of civil law going back to England that a government is responsible for protecting people who can't protect themselves.There is a risk that government may have civil suits for failing to provide proper mental illness care.  A Federal judge awarded $5.4 million in such a suit in 1999.Dane County Wisconsin has a team of 5 to 15 mental health professionals who take round the clock responsibility for mental health patients.  They provide care including medication maintenance, housing, job training, and rehabilitation.It was found in a study that 57% of schizophrenic patients studied were not aware they had schizophrenia to a ""moderate to severe"" degree.  In these cases, the brain often has anosognosia, which means the person in unable to recognize it has a disorder.  With Alzheimer's patients, anosognosia is a permanent condition.  Anosognosia in schizophrenics exists in the frontal lobes, the parietal lobes, and connections between these two lobes.  Anosognosia thus affects multiple brain areas.  Anosognosia is the primary reason why someone with mental illness does not take their medication for their mental illness.  When the law requires a person to request treatment in order to receive treatment, a person with anosognosia will not be treated.  Sadly, anosognosia is linked to increased violent behavior.After the Lesard decision, every state by 1980 had adopted laws restricting the involuntary institutionalization of the mentally ill.A New York study found that mentally ill homeless who were supposed to be but were not taking their medications were 40 times more likely to commit a violent crime and 27 times more likely to commit a non-violent crime than were mentally ill people requiring medication who were in stable housing environments.Studies indicate that at least 5% to 10% of people with severe psychiatric illness will engage in at least one serious act of violence per year.It is conservatively estimated that people with severe mental illness commit at least 5% of murders.  About 50% to 60% of murders committed by a mentally ill person are of a family members.  By contrast, a family member is killed in 16% of murders committed by someone without a mental illness.The violent behavior of a minority of people with mental illness has created a stigma for all people with mental illness.People with epilepsy are required to make medication before operating vehicles.  The author notes further laws requiring the taking of medication by people with additional mental health issues may be required.A New York study found that 40%of mentally ill patients discharged from hospitalization are re-hospitalized within six months. An Illinois study found 30% of mental health patients discharged are re-hospitalized within one month.A study showed that mental illness patients who likely were taking their medication were 3% more violent than others in a 10 week period compared to those who were not likely taking their medication who were 14% more likely to commit violence.  This study concluded that mentally ill people were not significantly more likely to commit violence than their neighbors.  The author notes those with a anosgosia were not included in this study, which skewed the sample. This study also compared rates of crime within the high crime rate neighborhoods were mentally ill people tend to live.The author supports a law that broadens the scope of requiring involuntarily treatment.  Assisted Outpatient Treatments laws have passed several states to allow for the involuntary treatment of seriously mentally ill people who pose a danger.  These treatments are given to people with past experiences with violence, are substance abusers, have anosognosia, are refusing to properly take their medications, are displaying antisocial behaviors, and have a neurological impairment.  It is noted that 85% to 90% of people in this category are male.A hospital uses criteria to know when to have extra security on hand.  Using similar criteria as descried previously reduced violent acts in one hospital study by 92%.The author recommends developing a data base of high risk people by judicial order.  This would be available only to law enforcement officers, authorized mental health personnel, and to a limited degree to firearm dealers who would not be allowed to sell a firearm to a name that checks against this list.There are numerous ways to move people towards treatment.  Those charged with misdemeanors could be provided the option of taking their medications versus imprisonment. The author also mentions that government benefits could be withdrawn to those not taking their medication.State governments are urged to collect more data.

Beyond the fence near his house, he sees people, but is confused by their strange striped pajamas and their sad demeanor.Bruno's loneliness is somewhat relieved when he becomes friends with a boy on the other side of the fence. They meet daily and exchange comments about their daily lives, but neither fully understands the circumstances of the other.Boyne presents a story about the Holocaust like none other before. He brings tragedy to life through the eyes of innocent children. Readers of all ages will be spellbound until the last page and beyond.Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka ""Readingjunky""",5.0,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,1163721600.0,"11 17, 2006"

To my utter happiness a fantastic character showed up--Lieutenant Jack Daniels--and I just couldn't stop reading.  Thank god it was only a novella.The serial killers--yes, there are two, and it's kinda like a first date of sorts--were sick as hell, yet unnervingly interesting.  And I was horrified to find my new favorite female police officer at their tender mercies...but I was suddenly ravenous to find out how she out-witted and dispatched these two sicko's.I can't say I want to read anymore about the two serial killers, though I read there are more stories about them, but I am definitely going to pick up another Jack Daniels novel to get lost in.",5.0,"A very, very good read.",1334275200.0,"04 13, 2012"

I'm a dedicated air gunner and have either tried most other A/G pistols or owned them, I'm a older guy. Only the Crosman 1377c pneumatic in .177 (now also in.22) which I also own, can compare for value or ownership. I have a ""Patio Range"" and shoot at 10m from a bench rest with sand bags with accuracy my priority, the 2240 delivers for me quarter size groups with a BSA red/dot shooting Crosman H/P's,7.9 gr. I'm satisfied with that,and I can get them at Walmart cheap. a scope would tighten up the group. I also get 50+ shots per cylinder. The one downside to this pistol is that its slow, no action shooting here. I've modified mine with a Crosman steel breech and Crosman cut down 12"" barrel, the after market accessories seem to be endless for this gun. The stock rear sight is funky but works just fine in standard trim. I even like the grips, these guns are very easy pistols to work on, think kitchen table. The Co2 starts losing power below 60 dg F, so its a warm weather gun. My gun holds Co2 very well, (months) I really have no complaints, be sure you add a drop of pellgun oil to the tip of the Co2 cylinder and the 2240 will last a very long time, mine is 7 yrs. old and still going strong. Every part has a number and stock parts are dirt cheap if ever needed. I'll probably buy another one and leave it stock so I can use a holster for my woods ""walk around"" gun. My gun hits very hard, it will blow thru starlings at my bird feeder range (30') and its not to noisy, it saves money from traveling to and from firearm ranges. I find the cost of shooting this pistol about the same as a .22 rim-fire (bulk) when everything is considered, pellets & Co2. My home range has much better amenities than ANY firearm range, and I get to shoot in my own back yard, whats not to like?.  this pistol is made in the USA, and I highly recommend it.

They made the effect supplement to the activities I designed for each brain rule.I appreciate that the author only includes solid, and repeated, research in his book.

They actually has just received them in my area, and IMMEDIATELY discounted the base unit and ALL THE ATTACHMENTS. So naturally I picked it up. Just to be clear, I own a mainly Dewalt power tools. I already have a Dewalt 18v XRP hammer drill, two Dewalt 18v XRP drills, a Dewalt 18V flashlight, a Dewalt 18v XRP impact driver, as well as a Dewalt 10 amp corded drill, a Dewalt corded random orbital sander, and a Dewalt corded circular saw, a Dremel SawMax, a Dewalt corded jigsaw, a Sonicrafter oscillating tool, an MK Diamond 5&#34; handheld tile saw, not to mention an 11 amp and a 12 amp Milwaukee Sawzall. So I don't NEED another drill, or impact driver. But the novelty of the interchangeable heads appealed to me.SO... I picked up the base unit, and the attachments the big box Home something store was selling *the impact driver, detail sander, trim saw, jigsaw, and the oscillating tool attachment. I then headed over to the other big box store and picked up the router attachment, and the 20v Li-Ion leaf blower/weed whacker combo set on sale, it comes with a quick charger better than the one with the base Matrix, and TWO more batteries for the price of TWO BATTERIES! Essentially the blower and weed whacker and charger were free. THEN I headed over to Sears, where they sell the competitive Bolt-On version. The clerk told me it wasn't compatible, but I came prepared with the impact driver and a charged battery. I popped the battery in their display model, and the impact driver head on and voila! It worked just peachy. The Craftsman version had a hammer drill attachment and an air inflation tool, so naturally I picked those up as well as their bag. Then I went back and grabbed the reciprocating saw attachment when it came out.Bottom line... Do I NEED these tools? No. I have every one of them in another form. But I like having a cordless interchangeable option. My Dewalt 18V impact driver blows this Matrix 20V Lithuim Ion out of the water. But for 95% of what it gets used for it's fine. I even reach for it more often now. These tools aren't perfect. They are, however, a hell of a lot cheaper than buying each of these tools as a stand alone version from one of the higher end manufacturers like Dewalt, Bosch, Milwaukee, or Makita.So if you're just doing so home improvement projects here and there I would definitely say get these.

While they do like board games, we actually rarely finish one because they move onto something else or just want to move around.  Elefun Snackin' Safari is a super fun game to get kids moving.  It is a game for kids ages 3 and up, and I genuinely feel a 3 year  old could play it and understand it.  All you have to do is snap down your elephant trunk and have it suction-cup to a card.  We had no problems with the cards sticking and my boys had a blast.  The length was perfect and they were able to comfortably hold the elephant in their hands, as was I.  The game is for two players only, which may be a drawback if you have more than two kids, but it goes pretty quick as there are only 13 snack cards to snack up!

The belt is made of sturdy sections of leather held together by two tiny, thin and weak connectors.

I repaired it with leather adhesive under the connectors, and reinforced the other connectors with the adhesive as well.  However, most people don't have a home workshop like mine that would have things like that available.

A2Q6C03WBWO14G,0898756138,Beck,"[14, 17]","I could choose from a few different angles to take with my review. I could just write about my own personal opinion about the book, and tell you to take that at face value, or I could write to convince you why my opinion is justified, in the hopes of saving you money from buying this book. Kim Jong-Il, however, has already done much of the work for me, when he wrote his preface to the book (find it in the product description). I'll repeat it here, as I think it offers more than enough insight to what the book is like:""The cinema is now one of the main objects on which efforts should be concentrated in order to conduct the revolution in art and literature. The cinema occupies an important place in the overall development of art and literature. As such it is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolution and construction. Therefore, concentrating efforts on the cinema, making breakthroughs and following up success in all areas of art and literature is the basic principle that we must adhere to in revolutionizing art and literature.""Allow me to break this down sentence by sentence. His first statement is rather bold (regarding cinema as a forefront of art and literature), yet he offers nothing to back up this claim (I know, it's just the preface, but you wont find any justifications in the book either.). Moreover, why would such a revolution be necessary, wanted, or even interesting to read for that matter? As has been previously noted, repetition can be found throughout (e.g. the preface's first 2 sentences: ""The cinema... art and literature."", ""the cinema"" and ""revolution"" are repeated 3 times in 4 sentences, ""art and literature"" repeated 4 times, twice in the last sentence.). All 4 sentences of this preface say roughly the same thing: Cinema, being an important part in art and literature, can be a useful tool in revolutionizing the whole. I hope that's enough.I can imagine only one reason to read this book: to see (if only a minor amount) into the mind of a person in a position of great influence. Let me say, it is my own opinion, that you'll get the jist of the book just from reading the preface a couple times.",1.0,As good of an author as he is a leader.,1282089600.0,"08 18, 2010"

On the island, you don't have to worry about the neighbors' dogs chasing you, or that shady looking guy standing up on the next corner. You don't have to worry if it's late at night, or early morning. You don't have to worry about it raining or storming on you, or dying of a heat stroke in the sun either!! =]I like the trainers; they encourage me to keep playing every day; I like to hear what kinds of things they come up with to say. I mainly use Warren as my Trainer. He flirts with me, and that amuses me, LOL!!You can use the Wii remote and nunchuck, the Wii balance board, or the DDR mat with this game. I use the Wii Balance Board. You step to the beat of the songs. Everytime you hit the beat, you get points; use those points to buy trees, buildings, new songs, open up new routes, and more! (when you use the nunchuck & remote, you put the nunchuck in your pocket like a pedometer).You can change the difficulty level to make it easier, which I reccommend for beginners.You can add things to your queue (the 3 cirlcles at the top, middle of the screen), and then when you have enough points, you get the item. For example, let's say you want to buy a tree for 50 points, but you only have 10 points. You click on the capsule anyway, and it adds it to your queue. Once you get 50 points, the item automatically is purchased. But now, you have to walk back and find the capsule again, and this time it will be glowing, so you'll know that you've already bought it. Click it, and VOILA - there's your tree!CONS:I don't care much for the mini games included, but I haven't really given them much of a chance.Some of the songs are crap, but there are enough songs that I like to keep me satisfied.You walk past the same character over and over again throughout the game.

And they really do rock the house here.  Listen to Dennis ""The Little Drummer Boy"" Diken ""bash away, bash away all"" during the intro to the Smithereens' own version of ""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree"" while Jim Babjak's electric guitar decks the halls with reens riffs, Severo's bass pumps along at full ""thrilla throttle"" and Pat DiNizio croons in maximum rock `n' carolling mode.  This is obviously not your average piped-in holiday music at the mall snoozefest.There is much to enjoy on this Christmas album beginning with its majestic opener ""Waking Up On Christmas Morning"" written by lead guitarist Jim Babjak.  It is one of three Smithereens originals on this CD that also includes ""Christmas (I Remember)"" and a rerecording of their song ""All Revved Up"" that's been re-revved up and revamped as ""Christmas Time All Over The World"".  The Smithereens also add their own holiday dressing to some Christmas classics and semi-rare covers.  Pat contributes some exuberant harmonica playing to Elvis' ""Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)"" while the guitars chug along like a runaway ""Polar Express"" train.  The Smithereens also surf the yule tide with an excellent cover of the Beach Boys' ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" and do a really rollicking version of Chuck Berry's ""Run Rudolph Run"".  The album later takes a side trip to Who-ville when Jim Babjak sings ""Christmas"" from the Who's ""Tommy"" album ""and you know that can't be bad"" when the Smithereens joyously revisit fab four territory with the Beatles' ""Christmas Time Is Here Again"".  They even salute the Ramones with a catchy punk vs. Motown re-arrangement of their holiday song ""Merry Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight)"".  The band also rocks in the New Year with their Christmas carolers on steroids version of ""Auld Lang Syne"".""Christmas with the Smithereens"" delivers a much needed kick in the Christmas balls to an often tired and tiresome holiday music industry.  It's the perfect antidote to overly treacly Christmas ""pap music"" and sugar shock inducing holiday elevator music.

PRISCO,"[0, 1]","It's nice to see Peter Banks getting some recognition now, which about as well-deserved as the lack of it he had previously.A big part of the this album's appeal rests with the staggeringly star-studded support, though  it is somewhat thinly spread: John Wetton, for example, is credited only for one short track mid-album. Phil Collins has never been particularly outstanding as a drummer. Steve Hackett plays through most of this, making this something of a Yes-meets-Genesis album. Like both those bands, there's a rather labored quality to the compositions (which form what was side 1 of the LP).In contrast, there's an agreeably informal quality to the concluding jams that feature fellow guitarist Jan Akkerman, with whom Peter enjoys energetic repartee. These were previously side two of the LP -- arguably worth the price in themselves, for fans of long, spontaneous jamming between kings.Consequently, we find an album possessed of interesting aspects, not too heavily weighted toward friendly improvisation nor strict composition: songs and probing jams in equal measure, truly ""two sides"" of Peter Banks.

Rather than portraying the Philippines as the proud emerging market that it has become and the role that the US has played in that remarkable story, the author states that the Filipino people are largely dishonest and that an entire generation of women between the ages of 18 to 24 are prostitutes.There can simply be no excuse for such writings. Thousands of the women who he wrongfully claims are working on their backs are actually working in call centers throughout the country.  The Philippines is the number one outsourcing destination in the world and it has surpassed India as the number one location for call center work.

Koenigsberg,"[6, 8]","Funny how tastes differ.I do love everything by Xenakis, but .... when I listen to this CD, ""Kassandra"" is my favorite.Sometimes I even find myself skipping through the other pieces, and only listening to ""Kassandra"" in its entirety.But ""Kassandra"" never fails, to thrill and chill me. It is one of my most favorite of Xenakis' pieces (and I'm a big fan, I've heard a lot of his music, either live or on CD's, and I was privileged to meet him a few times, etc.).I only give this CD 4 out of 5 stars, only because I am way more fond of ""Kassandra"" than I am of the rest of it.... and the live ambient (analog) recording, though not bad, is not the absolute best audio quality I could imagine; though that is partially due to the ridiculously extreme dynamic range that had to be captured, in the performance of the pieces, from the loud loud percussion down to much quieter sounds.I would say that ""Kassandra"" is one of my favorite Xenakis pieces (and being a big Xenakis fan, that is saying a lot), but the instrumentals on the rest of the CD sometimes grow tiresome to me (it's still Xenakis, so it's still great, just not among my favorite pieces of his).If you do love the extended vocal style of ""Cassandra"" as I do (a deep male baritone voice, often desperate, often wildly gyrating between deep tones and shrieking falsetto), you will also probably like Xenakis' piece ""Ais"", also for a male voice, which has been recorded several times on some of his other CD's. I think ""Ais"", like ""Cassandra"", is also another addition to his Oresteia family of pieces? (also the voice in ""Ais"" is amplified unlike that in ""Kassandra"", and I think ""Ais"" is for a tenor, rather than baritone?)someday I'd love to hear a new performance, of a most ""complete"" Oresteia, with ""Kassandra"", ""Ais"", and any other newer additions he made to the original suite?And yet another vocal piece of his that I really love, in addition to ""Kassandra"" and ""Ais"", is one called ""N'Shima"" (for ""amplified peasant voices""), also recorded more than once I think.plus to round out the mentioning of Xenakis' vocal pieces, there are a couple more choral works, on a CD shared with some of Messiaen's choral pieces.",4.0,"actually I prefer ""Kassandra""",1134432000.0,"12 13, 2005"

If you are equally tired of listening to tenured publicly overpaid diversity professors  drone on about the percecution / profiling of muslim men, also sick of socio-communist ""journalists"" living, writing, and enriching themselves in the land of the free, only to deride Uncle Sam every chance they get. Then buy this book, unlike much of what the leftist media write about, Goldberg's essays are filled with truth and fact instead of the outright lies and imaginary conservative demons liberals seem to be so fond of taking pen to. Thank You Mr. Goldberg.... p.s. One problem, by making him number 37, you have assigned way to much importance to Al Franken's role in the current media shootout, Mr. Franken has lent just about about the same amount of talent to the liberal media's cause as he did to SNL way back when real comedy writers like Dan Akyroyd, Michael O'Donahue and Gilda Radner had us rolling on the floor in convulsions. Franken was and is still, only riding the coat tails of people largely more talented than himself. You got your 15 minutes Al, its time to cut your losses, call it a day and give someone with real talent a chance at some air time....",5.0,Goldberg's Golden Hammer,1123891200.0,"08 13, 2005"

These clusters are so small that you couldn't even call them that if this was cereal.  What we've really got here is a granola cereal with bits of chocolate in it to be eaten a pinch at a time.CHOCOLATE CHUNKS: Looking at the granola through the window in the packaging you would think you could hardly taste the chocolate, like when you're eating Chips A'Hoy and somehow get a cookie that only has a couple of chips in it, but you actually taste plenty of chocolate in every bite.  It's very good, not too sweet, and very chocolatey without murdering the taste of the granola--which is also delicious.WHOLE GRAIN: There are two main reasons why whole grain is good.  First, it's more filling; one sandwich made with whole grain bread is as filling as two sandwiches on white bread for example.  You simply wont feel the need to keep stuffing yourself and that will reduce your total calorie intake by hundreds of calories per day if you have whole grain snacks like this one in addition to whole grains in your meals. The other is that whole grains range from tougher to impossible to metabolize, so your body works harder, burning more calories trying to do that (calcium does this too by the way, so it's a good idea to take a swig of milk with your whole grain snack).One added feature of whole grain is that it adds volume to your stool, so make sure to have that plunger at the ready if you're suddenly adding whole grain foods to your diet.PACKAGING: If I saw this on the shelf in the supermarket I would assume it's a cereal to put milk into or to top yogurt with.  Whomever designed the packaging and omitted the word 'snack' should be flogged.WITH MILK, EATEN WITH A SPOON: Hey, guess what, it is good as a cereal.  A half cup serving, with milk, would be about 350 to 400 calories I guess, which isn't bad for breakfast.THE F-WORD: Yes, it's got fat in it, like all granola, but since it's not in bar form, molded together with marshmallows or corn syrup you really shouldn't worry about it.  'Fat is the flavor' as the saying goes, and that warning only purtains to people who somehow think one bag of cookies should be eaten in one sitting.  Even the suggested serving size here is quite large for a snack.  Personally I found myself eating two pinches of this granola whenever I went into the kitchen to feed an urge to eat something, and that was enough to do the trick.  So don't worry about the slightly over the line fat percentage.If you're really worried about gorging yourself not only on granola, but ice cream or crackers and cheese and other delicious little goodies, don't bring the whole container with you to the living room for your several hours of nightly television.  Instead, put any snack you're going to eat in a 6oz custard cup and don't fill it more than three quarters of the way--which is about half a cup since it gets wider towards the rim.BOTTOM LINE: There really isn't any supplement that can substitute for getting your nutrients and whole grains from actual food such as granola.This is really delicious, healthy, proper snack food to get you through those periods between meals when you just want to stay satiated, keep your energy level up, and reduce any cravings you might have for something bulkier and with more calories.",4.0,"Only one star taken off for not putting the word ""snack"" on the packaging and the clusters being too small.",1243555200.0,"05 29, 2009"

A1L20MX19ZMNW5,B0014CSNDY,paisleymonsoon,"[2, 2]","The creators of this CD really got it right. Having only ever done yoga from book diagrams and descriptions, I found this venture into yoga on DVD quite refreshing. I was sort of concerned that the verbal instruction would detract from the routine or that the instructor would move from one thing to another too quickly for me to look up to follow. However, the way that the DVD is set up is that you see a video of Shiva Rea doing the yoga routine in beautiful relaxing settings such as in front of a waterfall, in the middle of a forest, or on the beach. However, she's not talking during the yoga routine. Instead, the instruction and music is all tastefully added as separate tracks. You can choose to just watch the routine, watch it with just the music, or watch it with an off-camera narrator of the various movements. I also like how the camera pans at just the right moment so that you can get a different view of Shiva Rea to make sure that you've got the pose right. Another great feature of the CD is that the different parts of the yoga routine are divided into separate chapters so that you can start wherever you would like.The poses themselves are fairly simple and basic. There's no standing on your head or doing ridiculous things that the beginner couldn't join in with. Despite the slow nature of the routines, your heart and muscles get a nice work out. There were only a few times that I found myself unable to stretch my legs out quite like she could, but I'm sure practice will get me there.The only thing I think could be a little better would be the explanation of when to inhale and when to exhale. With a very slow yoga routine, I tend to forget which one I'm supposed to be doing, so I wish the narrator would have mentioned it more often. Also, I'd hoped the DVD would contain more than one routine so that I wouldn't get bored doing the exact same thing over and over again.Overall, I found the DVD to be quite enjoyable. I'll definitely prefer it to following instructions from a book.",5.0,Tastefully Done,1210809600.0,"05 15, 2008"

So make sure you have an entire evening dedicated to reading if you pick up this book because you won't want to put it down!My Opinion:I want to start off by saying that out of all paranormal creatures zombies rank lowest on my list of favorites. I have tried repeatedly to read various zombie themed books and one after another they made it to my CNF list. (Could Not Finish) I gave After Life Lessons a chance because I am smitten with both of the authors and everything I've read from both has yet to disappoint me. That being said, After Life Lessons was the first zombie book that I actually was able to finish reading and enjoyed!I truly wasn't expecting this book to floor me like it did! This book changed my perception of the zombie genre all together. This book has a new take on the classic Zombie Apocalypse, one I find to be far more realistic to how people would respond during a zombie out-break. Most representations are filled with too much drama, cruelness, and far-out crazy antics that make the overall story hard to relate to. I find that the way the characters react in this book represents how people would really handle this type of disaster. They show the true gritty emotions; fear, love, courage, regret, and compassion. This book also has a perfect balance of zombie scenes placed throughout it. It's about so much more than just zombies, trust me.Emily and Aaron are a definite power-couple. They are like day and night, but they fit together great. Opposites really do attract, I suppose. They have so many obstacles to face but always make it through them because they have each other. They understand each other in such a profound way, if only everyone could have a chance to be in a relationship like theirs. It goes both ways, when it's going bad.. It's really damn horrible but when it's going good... It's just amazing! As a warning, when these two are alone things tend to get steamy, so make sure to keep a fan near to help with the spike in temperature.After Life Lessons put my emotions one hell of a ride that I'm not sure I'll ever recover from. It drained me physically and mentally, but I consider that to be a good thing. Any book that can have that much of an impact on me has to be special. This book has everything you could ever want in a novel... action, humor, romance, and sex. I could barely stumble out of my bed after one particular scene... oh the shock and horror I experienced. I can't share details of that scene here because it would spoil the plot. So if you're curious you will just have to read this fantastic book for yourself.

A15JJFM0OHA05Z,0140267581,Matt Burrows,"[1, 1]","Those who know and value the John Hawkes of old (Second Skin, Travesty, Blood Oranges) may be disappointed with Irish Eye. Hawkes, who once said, ""The true enemies of the novel are plot, characters, and setting,"" has forsaken his prior belief with the publishing of Irish Eye. The book itself is a mildy interesting text best representative of a nightmarish fairytale, as it surrounds readers with a unique view of Ireland and tracks the journey to maturity of young Dervla as she strives to find love and her place in the world. Along the way Hawkes treats readers to various interesting characters, of which Teddy seems the only character to represent the Hawkes of old--tortured, confined, and just angry at the world he refuses to give in and comprise. And so Dervla, our wide-eyed and innocent narrator, follows him all the way. Though some may claim Irish Eye to be a nice introduction to John Hawkes, don't let this fool you...these comments are made simply because this book is ""easier"" to read. Yes, some of Hawkes major themes are present (disorder and obscurity), but the constriction of characters and reactions/truths that arise from this are largely absent. If you're looking for an actual quality introduction to John Hawkes I would suggest Travesty or possibly Second Skin (with Second Skin being the more difficult read of the two). Overall, a major joy of Hawkes is deciphering that which he writes in order to truly understand the human condition and his fragmented, often disorganized novels challenge readers to not only reread numerous passages but ultimately come to their own conclusion of what the text tells them about life. And with this focus in mind, Irish Eye ultimately comes up short. All authors have a glitch in their library of writings and this seems to be Hawkes. An interesting read--yes.

When you have no expectations, you can never be disappointed.  So I was pleasantly surprised that MLB 2K12 has turned out to be a pretty decent game-pad baseball game.  Perhaps I'm just lucky but on my Dell Inspiron notebook it runs very smoothly with no problems at all.  Game play is very good but a lot of what you experience depends on what roster you're using and your tune file settings.I would suggest to anyone who wants a better MLB 2K12 to visit mvpmods.com  No I'm not spamming for them but they have dedicated people over there who mod baseball games to make them look and play better.  What they offer for this particular game is better than anything 2K Sports can supply.  This review is based on what I've downloaded from that site regarding roster files and difficulty tunes.Playing individual games in the Franchise Mode feature I've had many great battles, close games, blow outs.........pretty much what you would expect playing major league baseball.  Some starters go deep in the game (well over 100 pitches), extra inning nail biters, just about everything really.  Using an XBox controller for the PC seems to be the best option for this game, you don't have to re-map your button controls and you have full control over everything using this.  I would recommend this pad for this particular game if you don't already have one.I took a star off the ratings because like others have said, getting online to play someone is damned near impossible.  The new feature of this game, the MLB ""Living Season"" is also pretty much broken but like I said above, the Franchise Mode works just fine (as does one off exhibition games if that's all you want to do).  One thing though, baseball games like this will never ever replace a good sim like OOTP if you're looking for that sort of statistical gameplay only.So in closing, if you're XBox or PS3 free like I am and want to continue the tradition of PC baseball, this game is it.  Modify it the right way and you've got a pretty decent game-pad based baseball gaming experience.",4.0,Pretty good gamepad baseball,1335916800.0,"05 2, 2012"

A33DF1KSNX4SHK,1420106805,Angela Korra'ti,"[0, 1]","Scoundrel, Book 2 of Zoe Archer's Blades of the Rose series, came across my radar with a bang thanks to the Smart Bitches Trashy Books ladies and their current montly book club. As I mentioned in my review of Book 1, Warrior, I was very happy to see a cover with a hero who's not only fully dressed, but who also seemed to come right out of a mold I find most swoonable indeed: the Indiana Jones archetype, ready for adventure.Even more so that with Book 1, Scoundrel delivered this in spades. I enjoyed Scoundrel quite a bit more, in no small part due to the hero. Bennett Day of the Blades of the Rose is an unhesitant rake, cheerfully cutting a swath through the dozens of women willing to go at it with him in the sheets in between his far more serious missions for his compatriots, and sometimes both at once. Little does he know he's about to meet up with London Harcourt, the daughter of an Heir of Albion--and whose husband Bennett in fact once killed. London has no idea whatsoever of the nefarious activities of her father and spouse, and suffice to say, her worldview is blown wide open when she finds out that her father has hauled her off to Greece to make use of her gift with ancient languages. Harcourt's bent on tracking down the same Source Bennett's pursuing, and Bennett and his fellow Blades have no choice but to abduct London, clue her in, and hope like hell that she'll defect to their team and help them.A couple of things kicked Scoundrel up another notch over Book 1 for me. One is the secondary romance playing out between the witch Athena and the boat captain Kallas, which was in some ways almost more fun than the primary romance of London and Bennett--but only almost, because I had great fun with them too. I very much liked that London had refreshingly little angst about Bennett's womanizing ways, which led beautifully into Bennett flooring himself with his obligatory Realization of True Love(TM). The big revelation of said True Love in particular was quite charming; look for the ""monkeys in hats"" lines, here.I also have to give Archer props for actually making me not skim past a sex scene, for once. If an author is going to actually make me read a sex scene, she needs to have either a masterful command of the language and make me swoon on the sheer power of words alone. Or, she needs to say something interesting about the involved characters, and give me something more to go on than just the physical depiction. Archer does the latter in a goddess-play scene that I'll freely admit was, indeed, rather hot for the delightful things it said about London as a character and as a woman.Meanwhile, in the main plot, we've got ourselves a chase through Greece through lovingly described islands and waters. The Heirs are still fairly flat as villains--I still never really get a sense of any of the Heirs as actual people rather than bad guys spouting ""For the Glory of Britain!""

In the Introduction, the author writes: ""It is important to keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive Greek language course nor is it a 'Greek phrase book.' Rather, it is intended to be a very quick, very simple introduction to a few of the most basic principles of modern Greek for the student, traveler, or explorer."" This is why I give the book 4 not 5 stars. I was really looking for more of a 'phrase book' and not such a rigorous language course, even if it is a short one. There are ""key phrases"" in each lesson, and they are super useful. But the book was a little too ""serious"" for me.

A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG,1783060581,Viviane Crystal,"[1, 1]","Alesha is the classic &#8220;feral youth,&#8221; and this is her heartbreaking story.  Illiterate, unwanted by her parents, kicked out of every school she attempted to attend, and feeling totally unloved except for her best friend, J.J. who only shows love and care to his elderly grandmother, &#8220;Nan.&#8221;Alesha truly believes she has no options.  There&#8217;s a whole body of language that&#8217;s the Jamaican patois lingo of the gangs in the south end of London and the author supplies a glossary of meaning to those who haven&#8217;t a clue what life is like for these youths.  Most will never survive their young adult years; the others will wind up in jail. Their world is one of &#8220;survival of the fittest, but Alesha wonders in other words what exactly she&#8217;s fit for?This young, 15 year-old girl, earns her money by stealing clothes, delivering dope, cowering in fear to the leaders of gangs who are also at war with each other.  Several times Alesha is the victim of violence, especially when she fails to pay up after one of her drug deliveries goes bad or when she fails to acknowledge that she is owned in reality by those bigger in the criminal hierarchy of the Peckham Crew.  Her closeness to J.J. and earning &#8220;p&#8217;s&#8221; (money) is her whole world and that world is about to undergo a violent transformation.Early on in the story Alesha meets a middle-aged woman and piano teacher, Miss Merfield, who tries to show Alesha she does have options.  Depending on one&#8217;s point of view, one might feel deeply for Alesha&#8217;s attempts to change her life&#8217;s direction or one might perhaps feel quite irritated with her caustic responses in multiple scenes. For her lack of self-respect yields consequences in which she consciously or unconsciously sabotages her own chances for beginning a different lifestyle with reputable employment and education.  Others outside of her gang world certainly haven&#8217;t an ounce of sympathy for gang members like Alesha and a sense of empathy is as close as another planet.  For few of us can even imagine this poignant, tragic lifestyle endured on a daily basis!One doesn&#8217;t enjoy this story but must acknowledge that it&#8217;s a necessary one that needs to be told.  For this astute author deeply believes that the public needs to acquire awareness of just how imprisoned these feral youths are in their own insecurities, fears, and the veneer of toughness.  One realizes how Alesha&#8217;s nasty attitude evolves from rejection to deep-seated anger that breaks out after any innocent or flagrant trigger appears.  One senses how sharing her story turns into a gross betrayal beyond words toward the end of the novel and another event will practically shatter her forever. No, it&#8217;s not far-fetched; it&#8217;s so very real, shocking!This novel was based on the actual 2011 Blackberry London riots.  Polly Courtney, kudos to you for taking on such a huge task of delineating the world of the disenfranchised, of those with no hope and no future.  Whether they succeed or fail, the Miss Merfields of this world deserve even more acclaim for attempting to bring hope to youth who have no basis of believing in anything beyond their criminal and hard-hearted environment!  Words are inadequate to convey the impact of this story that deserves world-wide attention &#8211; for it isn&#8217;t only England&#8217;s problem &#8211; it&#8217;s ours, wherever we live!

A3205Z96VCJAEO,0373210965,Waiting For Wentworth,"[1, 1]","From beginning to end, Heartbeat was such an emotional and heartbreaking story. Emma is dealing with a very difficult situation: her pregnant mother has been declared brain dead after an aneurysm, and her step-father, Dan, has made the decision to keep her body alive and on machines in order to save the baby.Emma visits her mother in the hospital every day, and every day it gets harder and harder for her to keep her thoughts and feelings to herself. She is trying to mourn her mother's death, but it is impossible when she sees her mother's body every day. She feels that her mother and the baby should be allowed to die, and she is angry at Dan for making such a huge decision without asking her opinion first. Emma is hurt and filled with pain and anger, which causes her to lash out at Dan repeatedly. She is often unreasonable, and blames her step-father for everything. It was SO easy to feel sympathy for Emma, but she isn't a likable character. I don't think she's meant to be likable, and that's okay. I was still able to care about her and her situation.Emma feels that her life is completely out of control until she lays eyes on Caleb at the hospital. She recognizes something in him, and they make a connection that they both desperately need. Emma can be herself around Caleb, and doesn't have to hide how much she is hurting. They spend time together and share their grief, knowing that they can't heal the other, but they can at least offer support and understanding.Caleb wasn't at all what I expected, and I found myself really liking him. He has a tragic past, heavy family issues, and terrible, awful parents. I liked that he and Emma were able to make such an unlikely connection. I thought their relationship was beautiful and complex, and they were really able to help each other.Emma's best friend, Olivia, was awesome and so understanding. She is Emma's link to life 'before', and she tried so hard to be there for Emma and support her no matter what. Emma was really lucky to have such a great friend in her life who cared about her so much.Even though Dan was made out to be the bad guy, I tended to side with him because I could relate to him more. I could totally understand his reasons for wanting to save the baby - he knows his wife is dead and the baby will be like having a piece of his wife still with him everyday. If there is the chance that the baby can survive, he is willing to do anything to make it happen.This subject is such a current controversial issue. I can understand the arguments for and against, and whether it is ethical to keep a pregnant woman alive to be an 'incubator'. I do believe the woman's wishes should be taken into account, along with the viability of the fetus. I thought all of these things were handled very well in Heartbeat.

A1X1ZS55QVPU1T,0306811839,Reel To Real,"[1, 1]","This is a disturbing biography for many reasons. I give it four stars because anyone who is fascinated by and wants to learn more about Serge Gainsbourg, as well as Jane Birkin, should read it. Why is it disturbing? First of all, the author, who prides herself on translating the titles of his songs, tells the reader (page 56) that the line in his most famous song 'Je t'aime, moi non plus' (in French only the first word of a song title is capitalized): ""je vais et je viens entre tes reins"" translates to English as ""I come and go between your kidneys."" What? The correct translation, which everyone knows (why didn't she?), is 'between your loins.' Okay, I'm carping about something irrelevant to the substance of the book. However, when it comes to substance, there is barely enough to convey a broad sense of the man and his life. Content is sketchy and woefully thin. What is disturbing is learning how unlikeable a character Gainsbourg actually was. He is the ultimate teflon upstart who charms everyone, gets what he wants, and gets away with everything. You might say 'what's wrong with that?' What's wrong is that he comes across as being too clever by half. I wanted to like him. The more I learned about him however, the less sympathetic I became. The author's juiciest source of information about Gainsbourg comes from her interviews with Jane Birkin. Gainsbourg was attracted to adolescent-like girls. When he met Birkin she was a prolonged adolescent young woman, the perfect type for him. Through her we catch glimpses of Serge at his control-freak worst. Since she is his chief apologist and ever-faithful fan, the real worst is yet to be revealed. What is REALLY disturbing, is what Birkin reveals about what she put up with in their relationship and how she defends Gainsbourg's immorality when it comes to his treatment of their daughter Charlotte. Birkin has some good insights about him, but when she says he was ""never cruel or violent"" she comes across as deluded. I was amused by her telling of the time she threw herself in the Seine to show how upset she was with herself (not with him) for embarrassing him in a nightclub bar. She didn't miss her opportunity to jump in the river, as unhappy French women in Paris occasionally do to express their despair. In the end it is clear that Gainsbourg and Birkin deserved each other. For him, she was the only one who could retain such tender feelings and tolerate his behavior for so long, to his everlasting benefit. What it says about Jane however, is sad.",4.0,DISTURBING,1392940800.0,"02 21, 2014"

Currently I am doing a case study on power and this book has accompanied that aspect well. While I don't agree with America asserting itself as a global power militarily, or even to some extent politically, I still find Zbigniew's assertions quite interesting, concise and correct. He delves into essentially a few subjects (summarized on page 185 in a report card): the Atlantic Alliance, Post-Soviet Space, Far East, Middle East, Proliferation, Peacekeeping, Environment and Global Trade/Poverty, with an emphasis on the first 5 subjects.His analysis of the roles in which these three presidents have played is, in my belief correct on all counts. Bush I was in the B range, Clinton in the C range and Bush II recieved an F. He was most critical of Bush II and most supportive of Bush I, while mixing both sentiments with Clinton. In my belief his support and criticism of all 3 has been rightful. He has asserted that America has fielded badly in its foreign policy and has gradually diminished its global status and influence while only strengthening its military in a world where almost daily we see how hard power and militaristic power is critically limited, while at the same time it diminishes soft power which inturn further limits and weakens hard power again.Many may inteperet Brzeinski's final chapter (Beyon 2008) differently, however in my eyes the following must be done in terms of foreign policy and the international community: America must retract and contract itself militarily while asserting an atlantic alliance more so on a political and economic basis as an equal partner rather than on military and defence basis as an elite protector. It must downsize its military bases and military spending, improve its domestic situation (especially eduaction and information) in order to create a politically active and inforemd society, reduce its political and economic support for Israel and become a moderator rather than remain partial. Hopefully in doing so America will reduce its impreial image to a growing developing world with anti-American sentiment and increase its soft power and improve mutual relationships, wether bilateral, trilateral or multilateral.This is a great read although at times his writing style was antognizing to read.

Casi McLean starts her book with her memories as a happy and loving child, and then moves through her life building the suspense.  What is the secret that her mother never shared?  Why does it have such an affect on her life and her relationships?  I particularly liked her description of high school in the late 60's.  It evoked the era so poignantly and realistically.  I also loved the way she intertwines her actual journal with the book, quoting excerpts as she goes along.  The painful honesty and soul searching are so touching that I felt overwhelmed by her pain.  Then the ending was inspirational and joyful.

When the time comes to remove the staples, the effect of these bends must be neutralized. This device accomplishes that task by inducing a 180 degree bend in the middle of the staple (the portion that is above the skin). One slides the &#34;tongue&#34; of the remover under the staple, centers it carefully and then squeezes the crimper causing the aforementioned 180 degree bend AND, at the same time, pulling the now-vertical staple ends up and out of the skin. It is painless and trivially easy. The only way to goof it up is to fail to center the tongue. Do not make that error or you may render the staple trapped in which case you'll need a chainsaw to remove it. Otherwise the whole procedure should cause no more than a gallon of blood loss tops.Seriously, these ARE easy to use, but if you at all squeamish or nervous about the process, have your surgeon or some other trained medical person remove your staples.",5.0,EASY AS PIE...

Or if you're compulsive like me, an afternoon and evening of good fun. I liked it, yes I did. I liked it because Bylina threaded a contemporary issue through a murder mystery. The issue? Why cannot a Catholic priest serve God while married? Bylina doesn't get real deep into the philosophy, but he does remind us it doesn't derive from Biblical mandates.Back to the mystery: money and lust. That's the engine. That always makes for good fun. Also a genuinely likable hero, which we have in Bylina's detective, who attempts to solve the crime while dealing with a teething baby. And the second protagonist, a nice young church musical director, fits perfectly into the narrative.Bylina brings in other elements that add to the realism -- racism, for one. I like the way he handled that insidious poison. And he didn't make it cliche -- the setting is Pennsylvania, and the young heroine is half-Mexican.What he also does well is weave in backstory to flesh out the narrative. That's always good, right? Makes a reader wan t to cheer.Be prepared for some super good plot twists. When he pulled the first one, I thought &#34;Wow! I did not see that coming.&#34;There's a lot to like about this mystery, and -- well, I understood the conclusion, but darn, I'm not sure it fit with my idea of the way things should turn out.

Catching Jordan was so good, I reread  it twice. Omg. And I hate rereading books, because I'm already going to know what's going to happen. But I guess not with Catching Jordan. ;DThe Cover:It's cute. The bike thing while holding hands. This is random but my brother rode on a  horse while holding hands with his wife for an engagement picture. This cover is kind of like that, but a younger version for teens.The Character:I really love how Miranda Kenneally's characters from the last two books appear in this book. We get to see more of the Jordan-Sam relationship and Parker-Will relationship, which I totally crave and ship. The third book introduces a new couple, Kate and Matt.Matt - Matt went to Cumberland Camp before when he was younger. Back then, he was quiet, shy, geeky. People teased him, bullied him, etc. He almost went suicidal. Until, he met Kate. Kate, who changed how he viewed himself and who kept him alive. Now, he's confident. He's funny, popular, hot. he had a girlfriend named Sarah. They had a three year relationship but they broke up. And Matt was so not expecting to fall in love. Again. With the girl he fell in love with so long ago.Okay, so Matt. Yep. The love story you would imagine. You meet him at camp. You fall in love. You date. Happily ever after. But Kate just couldn't do that.Kate - Kate is really religious. I have nothing against religious people, but she is so religious that I just want to kill her sometimes. And annoying. Like ohmyfreakingawd, what's wrong with you? Apparently, talking to a guy alone is sinning. And I'm like omfg girl, man up. And of course, kissing, making out is way out of hand. I get the no sex thing, but like no holding hands or talking? No wonder you don't have friends.What I like though, is that in a way, characters all connect to each other. Like despite Kate being way down low in the popularity chart, she was still able to go to one of Jordan's popular parties. ;DParker - Parker was already introduced in Stealing Parker. As of she's the main character. Either way, she kind of played a role in this book. She encouraged Kate and Matt's relationship and Parker and Kate actually ended up becoming friend which is good. There are a lot of relationships in this book, but it's cute and all.The Extras:If you haven't gotten the connection yet, Kate goes to Hundred Oaks High School.

On one level, it's incredibly sad to see the story of young lives ripped away when many would say it's too soon and it was a waste. On another, it uplifting to see the incredible faith and strength that these families displayed through the difficulties of missionary work and the devastation of losing the men in their lives. I think it would be hard to read this book as an unbeliever and take much from it beyond that it was a senseless tragedy. Looking at it from my perspective though, I find it challenging and something that everyone who calls themselves a Christian should read at least once in their life to experience what these families went through.There's just not much to say about this book really.

As I said, this app would be a great app for family members to always send nice cards to each other without paying a penny, but, because the designers of the cards made them the way they they are, it can't be used for that purpose.

A1NLVZ294AUJ4P,6305191867,Moviefanatic12,"[6, 6]","After 20 years, Henry remains one of the most compelling horror films ever made. The basic premise - a slice of life approach to the daily activities of a serial killer - had been done before (Bill Lustig's nauseating ""Maniac"") as well as since (the overrated ""Man Bites Dog""), but none approached the impact or verisimilitude of John McNaughton's chiller.Michael Rooker's intense offering is probably the only rendition of a serial killer that gives me nightmares. He seethes with rage and internal brokenness, and with the character of Otis, Tom Towles creates an inimitable caricature of a grotesque clown. Observing his progression from tortured accomplice to drooling necrophiliac is both disturbing and, occasionally, hilarious. In the audio commentary, McNaughton points out the humor that can be appreciated if you can tolerate the stench long enough to locate it. In the most reductive sense, Henry and Otis can be viewed as homicidal buffoons. Their reparte - particularly a post murder bit in a fast food parking lot, and Otis' ""slow on the uptake"" response when Henry hands him a gun in order to kill somebody - can be viewed as nihilistic Abbott and Costello bits.The film's shortcomings mostly enhance its impact. The lack of funds necessitated a harsh, occasionally underlit 16mm look that makes the goings-on all the more realistic. This film is a masterpiece of aesthetic minimalism. Few directors have made equally powerful films under the umbrella of slick hollywood productions.The DVD presentation is first rate. The transfer is clear, and the supplements - particularly a cache of deleted scenes, and a thorough doc present on a second disc - include pretty much everything a ""Henry"" fan could ask for.",5.0,THIS is horror!,1258070400.0,"11 13, 2009"

It smelled really wonderful but the scent was too strong to keep in a frequently used area, so I moved it a little further away from where people normally sit and then the smell was really nice.But in just a couple of days I could no longer smell the scent from that distance so I decided to move it into a small 1/2 bathroom. It did its job nicely for two more days and then there was no longer any noticeable scent. There was still plenty of liquid in the reservoir, so I picked it up and shook the unit gently. After a gentle shake I could sniff it closeup and the pleasant scent was still there. But it no longer produced a noticeable scent that would even slightly permeate in the small bathroom, its scent was only available if I physically put the unit near my nose.

On 10/10/2012 the second unit stopped displaying a picture but still played audio.  On 10/11/2012 I tried to return it to the store for my replacement and Target store informed me the warranty was handled through the phone, so I called Target and they stated the Philips warranty of one year needed to be completed before the Target replacement warranty could be used.  On 10/20/2012 I called Philips for their help in this matter.  they stated the unit was indeed out of warranty and if I truly did buy it on 1/14/2012 I would need to provide a valid proof of purchase and would need to provide them with a CC# in for a 25$ security fee in order for a replacement to be shipped out. On 10/20/2012 I emailed them a scan of the receipt.  I emailed them the next day to confirm they received it, no response.  I called them and they said they were working on it.  On 11/2/2012 I received a cable and I called Philips once again and asked what was going on.  I again informed them I already tried a replacement cable and it did not work (I stated this on 10/20 as well).  Philips told me it was a ""special"" cable and you could not buy it in stores, well, I Ohmed it out and it was a standard video to video cable.  At this phone call on 11/2/2012 I gave Philips my CC# and said I needed a replacement ASAP, they stated it would take 5-10 days to arrive then said the RMA return deposit had increased to 50$--odd.  On 11/12/2012 I called and the person stated their policy changed and it would now take 10-15 days to receive--odd.  On 11/17/2012 I called Philips again questioning the arrival of said replacement unit and they said I should receive it any day.  On 11/22/2012 I called again and they said it was on its way and I should receive it any day.  Finally this last Saturday, 12/1/2012 I was told they were having technical difficulties and they could not tell me whether it had shipped, where it was, if it did ship, and they could not track it at all.

The best Nerf guns are more fun and less expensive.On the plus side, it's very easy to use, and loading the ammo is a snap. We haven't had many misfires or jams. The plastic is decent -- it's not especially heavy duty, but it ain't exactly dollar-store quality, either. The little zombie target is pretty neat, and works as advertised. Hits result in red splotches that fade away after a few minutes. It's light enough to put up with a small tack but heavy enough that it won't tear.On the minus side, we're a little disappointed with the power and accuracy. The effective range only seems to be around 25-30 feet. (Bearing in mind that the ammo is barely large enough to be visible at that distance in bright sunlight, so even if the gun did fire farther, it would be nearly impossible to adjust your aim at longer range.) I suspect that lithium batteries would bump up the power, but those get expensive quickly. As for the accuracy, it's alright for target shooting, but don't expect to hit a moving person at farther than about 15 feet.The ""scope,"" literally just a plastic tube that mounts to the top of the barrel, is for looks only. It's essentially the same as peering through a paper towel roll. You can leave it off if you like.On one hand, the dry ammo is conveniently small when stored. On the other, you have to soak it for 90 minutes before using it, and once you soak it, you have to keep it sealed if you don't fire it right away, and might have to re-soak it. According to the manufacturer, the ammo material is biodegradable and was originally developed for the purpose of hydrating crops. You don't want to eat it, but it shouldn't harm your lawn or foliage.The verdict?

It's easy to figure out how to do basic things like printing, copying, etc., without needing a manual. My problems have been when I've tried to duplex print or scan multiple pages into a pdf rather than a jpg. If I throw the docs in and either through the machine or my computer select 'scan' it automatically scans them into individual pages in jpg format without an easy option or selection for type of file I want. I couldn't quickly and easily figure out how to duplex print either. The manual refers most things to the cd-rom which lacks instructions for both of these issues.

While they are pretty quick to respond, the instructions are long, as in 12-15 steps, and sometimes a bit unclear, often leaving out key things ie: after duplex printing, you actually have to go back in to the software and deselect that feature. Otherwise the printer later jams or thinks it has jammed because it's still trying to print in duplex mode. I haven't been able to get a receipt of confirmation after I've faxed, only if the doc didn't go through. The manual covers the journal, but not the receipts.I never had these issues with any of my HPs. They are just touch and go. When scanning, I'd throw the doc or picture on, hit go and the software would automatically pop up and ask how I wanted it saved, where, and if I had any special requests. Easy-Schmeasy. I never needed the manual for anything, let alone having to refer to a cd-rom, a website and emailing tech support. Faxing and everything else was the same way. My only complaint was that the flatbed read a smaller area than the average size copier, so when I would make reduced copies even, it didn't read outside of the standard 8.5x11 size even though it was larger.I'm pretty computer savvy and if I'm having challenges with this, then it would be especially so for someone who isn't.",3.0,Decent Machine But Not Just Touch & Go,1285286400.0,"09 24, 2010"

Hopping and bopping through the mushroom kingdom, collecting coins, and so-on. Needless to say, when I saw this film I was apalled. How it ever made it onto DVD, I will never know. If the screensaver quality prologue at the start of the film isn't enough to scare you away from the movie, you'll soon notice that the film has very little in common with Sherigu Miyamoto's video game classic that it is named after. There are too many continuity issues to list in this short review, so I won't bother. But basically to sum up the film, if you drained Water World, filled it with weird half lizard-half human creatures and put two badly dressed italian americans in the middle of it you'd have Mario Brothers. If you are a die hard Mario fan, this film will deeply offend you. I wouldn't say it should be completely avoided, as it does offer a few un-intentional giggles, but the film itself it [not good].

This book is about a woman named Jocelyn (or Joss) whose parents and sister were killed in a car accident when she was 14. She has moved to Scotland, where her mother was from, to escape the painful memories. Joss has made herself have a tough exterior and not to let emotional things get in her way, which makes her bottle up all of her feelings inside, refusing to talk about her family. Joss moves into a flat with a girl named Ellie, whom she starts to love as a sister. Ellie also has a brother named Braden, and from the moment she meets him, her life will change. He brings out thoughts and feelings in her that she has refused to let surface for years.The author's writing style is excellent and I like that she would have Joss's inner thoughts next to what really came out of her mouth.

I wasn't very happy about that as I had used it only about fifty times.  Roomba offered to replace it with a top of the line scheduling model for a considerably reduced price to compensate for my loss.  However, it would not have a battery, docking station, charger or lighthouse.  I would have to use all the accessories from my old Roomba or buy anything else I needed.Since it was a top of the line model, I elected to get the new one.  I also decided I wanted to get a much better battery than what I had. After considerable research on these batteries from different sellers, I purchased this battery from ShopXtreme and it is an outstanding performance battery.  I believe it is identical to the one sold by iRobot.  In fact, I believe it is better.  It runs for almost two hours before needing recharge.  Before using it, I charged it for 16 hours even though it came with at least a partial charge.The design of their battery makes it impossible to put it in wrong because there is a protrusion which has to match up with the battery compartment and it will only go in one way.  That is important.The key thing to look for is the rating of the mAh, which is the mili-amp hours.  The higher that number, the better the battery is and the longer the run-time will be.  Mine was 3,500 mAh.  The battery sold by Roomba on their website is only 3,000 mAh and costs $89.00.  It doesn't take much to realize that the one at ShopXtreme is a great value.I would also caution you not to buy a NiCad battery which may look very similar to these and will also work in your unit.  It is an easy mistake to make and may be tempting because they cost less and look the same.  However they are the older version batteries much inferior to these and can develop a memory which will result in a short battery life and poor performance.  Make sure it is an Ni-MH.I can't speak for the other vendors, but if you order what I did from ShopXtreme, I am quite sure you will be happy and completely satisfied.",5.0,As good or better than iRobot original... from ShopXtreme,1282780800.0,"08 26, 2010"

Mel didn't spend enough writing time in developing a believable character here, in my humble estimation.Known for his past Gold Eagle novels, both in the Deathlands and Outlanders series, Mel Odom did his best work in the Deathlands series. (But his first foray into the Outlanders series was solid, too. It was his latter written books that were mediocre.)But back to his current work. Rogue Angel starts out in France, and has the reader following archeologist-turned-explorer-turned-TV monster show host-Annja Creed into a web of mystery and suspence. The overall storyline has potential, but the main character, along with the main bad guys, come off way too cookie cutter and one-dimensional and uncolorful.The action sequences are OK, but either come off too comic-bookish or like a computer game, like Tomb Raider. (That's really all I could unfortunately think of while reading this book.)Annja's two new sidekicks here become a timeless duo of an old man and a male model type, both were connected since watching the burning death of their liege, Joan of Arc, centuries before. Unfortunately, they have since become bitter enemies,(but which comes off too comically in the present timeframe.) Overall, the effect of realism just didn't work for me. These two characters could have been fleshed-out more cohesively.Now, I'm not the type of reviewer that tells readers all that happens in any given novel. I hate that. Gives things away, thus ruining anything for the potential reader. Suffice it to say, Mel Odom is a gifted writer at times.

It isn't too long before he - and Agutter, and Doctor John Woodvine - realize he isn't hallucinating.Very well-directed and -acted piece, balancing horror and humor nicely, though not as smoothly and subtly as the contemporaneous The Howling. The balance is carried off by straight-faced and nightmarish surrealism, and the wholesomeness of the genuinely appealing young cast. The clever juxtaposition of American and British culture helps immensely, adding both to the humor and the realism.This is a truly unique piece, not really succeeding either as a comedy or a horror film, yet satisfying somehow on both levels.

A3HEM1WWXXLOUL,B000002WNO,"""douglasnegley""","[8, 8]","I was floored by this CD when I first heard it. First of all, the sound, for a Live show, at Newport in 1967, is good. Second, the band - featuring players like Snooky Young, Joe Newman, Al Grey, Frank Foster, Jerome Richardson, George Duvivier...need I say more - is on high throttle, and obviously enjoying themselves. This Big Band is every bit as 'tight-loose' (if you catch my drift) as Dizzy's in '57, or Terry Gibbs' in '59. In fact, this band reminds me a whole lot of that Gibbs band in the way they swing, and sway, too. Both do great versions of &quot;Flying Home&quot;, also. I think it was the 'sway' that turned a lot of the 'baby-boomers' off to Big Band jazz. Hopefully, it is more appreciated these days, now that Geritol bottles are finding their way into the same generation's cabinents. Seriously, though, it is great, classic American music. This band shows the time period in which the Live recordings were made, also. &quot;Greasy Greens&quot; is a classic 1967-style pop-funk tune. &quot;Tempo's Birthday&quot; is one of my favorites, being both a 'swing' and 'sway' tune, punctuated with classic section 'hits' in the arrangement. Frank Foster's &quot;Misunderstood Blues&quot; is hilarious, as well as bluesy - a kind of 'tip-of-the-hat' to Clark Terry's classic vocal routine of the same variety. &quot;Meet Benny Bailey&quot; is a minor-mode vehicle for Snooky Young to shine on, which he surely does. Then comes the Hampton rhythm-and-blues classic &quot;Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop, with &quot;Hamp's Boogie Woogie&quot; inside of it, and this time, Hamp gets to show his piano chops, the band responding in full throttle. &quot;Flying Home&quot; finds Hamp doing what he does best: killing on the vibes. An encore, apropos of the period, features one more go 'round of &quot;Greasy Greens&quot;, featuring Billy Mackel on the electric guitar solo. The rest of the tracks are studio releases, but this CD ranks with the best Live swinging Big Bands of modern times. It is a hidden treasure.",5.0,Lionel and the All-Star Alumni Band COOKS!

(Wrist rests on the desk, fingertips are the only thing on the mouse, I move the mouse with just my thumb and pinky/3rd finger).- I have small hands (7 inches from my palm to the very tip of my middle finger).- I have used Logitech mice since the MX510 I bought in 2004. I've tried other mice, but they usually just don't work for my kind of  hand and grip. Either they are too large, too tall, or just plain aren't made for people who move the mouse with their fingertips. A great example of this is the Naga 2014. It has a place to rest the user's 3rd finger. It just doesn't work with a fingertip grip because I use that finger to move the mouse.I've really liked other logitech mice like the MX510, G500, and G700.. but I LOVE this mouse. It takes everything that was great about those other mice and makes it easier to use because of a lower profile. The sensor on it feels very accurate and if you want to get into specifics about it, look at some reviews about the new sensor. There is a bunch of stuff I could talk about and bore you to death, but lets just say its an amazing sensor that is very accurate. It will even have you &#34;scan&#34; the surface you use it on to calibrate itself to the surface.Overall this mouse is just amazing for people like me. If you have small hands and use the same kind of grip, I would give this a shot. Even if your current mouse is good enough, go give this one as shot and you won't be disappointed. If you have large hands, use a different grip, or just don't like the shape/profile that Logitech uses with their mice, your mileage may vary.

Turner uses various publicly known intelligence failures as reference points to specific and often very good comments on the structure and processes of intelligence production.

A1QA59ISWKCHHB,0316101621,Lawral Wornek,"[0, 0]","Let me start by saying that you should not judge this book by its cover. Or by its opening lines:""Frailty, thy name is woman."" - William Shakespeare""Willy, thy name is sexism."" - OpheliaDon't get me wrong, both have very much to do with the story (other than Hamlet's hair color on the cover), but they really make this look like a much lighter, funnier, beach read kind of book than it really is. I mean, really, how would one make an adaption of Hamlet light? Instead, this book is everything it should be; it's brooding and dark and, at times, intense. It's also narrated by a strong Ophelia who is understandably worried (and sometimes so tired/drunk she's a bit loopy - how else could one explain the flower scene?) about her boyfriend's apparent loss of sanity but who also does her best to be supportive and helpful to those around her, especially her aforementioned boyfriend and her widower father, all while trying to keep her own life together in the midst of circumstances no high school senior should have to deal with. She is so at odds with both the classic and modern versions of how we usually see the character of Ophelia. I loved it.The story stays pretty true to the original, with one major difference that is given away on the jacket flap: Ophelia survives. The motivations behind people's actions, however, are different. The ""truth,"" what Ophelia is telling us the readers, is book-ended by Ophelia's tell-all appearance on fake-Danish-Oprah in the beginning of each chapter and her interrogation by the Danish police at the end. These three concurrent tellings of the same story, illustrate the fabrication of what we take for ""fact"" from the media and the reach of a government cover-up more explicitly than that paparazzi pic on the cover ever could. On faux-prah, Ophelia is sweet, in love, heart-broken, and kind of ditzy. She's the almost princess. While being interrogated, she is bitingly sarcastic, angry, and fiercely loyal to Horatio and Marcellus, the only other people to survive the bloodbath that is this story. She's accused of being the master-mind of a plot to overthrow the Danish monarchy. In between, she's just a girl doing her best to do what's right for herself and those she loves.Really and truly, I loved this book. It sucked me into the story and kept me on the edge of my seat even though I knew, more or less, what was going to happen. The characters were well-rounded and real in ways that Shakespeare characters usually are not. I cried when the king died. Have you ever cared about Hamlet's dad enough to even care that he's dead? I haven't. And Hamlet himself made a bit more sense, not a lot, but a bit. Giving him a happy background with Ophelia, at least in flashbacks, made their whole relationship much more believable which made it all the more crushing when he becomes cruel. Michelle Ray has managed to take a story that I already knew well and liked, and she made it into something new and original that I love.

Then 3 weeks ago, the kids dropped their IPad 1 and absolutely destroyed it, because someone forgot to put on the Otterbox Auntie sent them. There is a moral to this story &#60;g&#62;. ;-)So, since the children's life and education was on their ipad, a replacement needed to be found. Luckily, Auntie just upgraded to the IPad Air and had my old IPad 1 just sitting in its box. So, I made a big care package and just sent it to them (it was tough as it looked brand new and I knew what it would look like in just 3 days &#60;vbg&#62; ;-)However, this time it was in an Otterbox which I was very tempted to superglue closed &#60;eg&#62;! Looking at that bulky, heavy and ugly Otterbox, I wished I could have replaced it with something much lighter, and cooler from Fintie, but could nit find anything. However, I did find Fintie's Galaxy cases, that I am discussing here, and included them in the gift box.When I decided I also wanted to protect their Galazys, but without spending lots of money, I turned to Fintie. I think they make some of the best cases, for the lowest prices! I bought each or the shield series for under $5 each! Go figure, as they told me the otterbox they looked at was about $100? Anyway, the point is, the Fintie cases I bought made the Otterbox look heavy, bulky and not nearly as nice looking. Even if it would protect my phone from a nuclear explosion, there is no way I would out that thing on my phone!I received a call from my very grateful relatives a week later. They loved the Ipad (of course, it was free &#60;g&#62;)! They said that the Galaxy note shield fit liked a glove, they loved it, and agreed it was a great alternative to the expensive otterbox.Just so you know, the Fintie cover is really constructed well, and will protect from much dust, dirt and water drops.It also has great coverage of all ports and it's jacket fits just perfectly. Although their is no front cover, I just sent them the top of the line screen savers. This saves a lot of weight and I still think their phones will be very safe. Besides, I just got their kids a new used IPad so mommy and daddy should keep their phone hidden from the kids &#60;g&#62;. Auntie has no more extra phones and pads if these break &#60;g&#62;. ;-)Bottom line is, if you have young children, get a heavy duty case. :)You don't need to spend a fortune because Fintie makes a great alternative at a wicked low price.

AYA29XLPT24EA,B000053306,AmazonReviewer,"[1, 1]","The following is not medical advice, but only one individual's response to a previous misleading negative review:Regarding puncture wounds:  A puncture wound, once carefully inspected for debris, cleaned, and treated with antiseptic ointment, should be fully covered using a bandage to prevent reintroduction of bacteria, and the wound should be re-cleaned and re-dressed (ointment and bandage(s) reapplied) as appropriate during the healing process.  (Of course, as with any wound, you should also monitor for any sign of infection and consult a medical professional immediately if any of these signs develop.  This step is especially important with puncture wounds, as one of the biggest risks of puncture wounds is infection caused by bacteria and/or foreign objects which cannot be reached and/or removed during irrigation and cleansing of the wound.)Regarding butterfly closures:  A butterfly closure would never be able to accomplish any wound coverage effectively since not only is it extremely narrow in the middle, but also there is no wound protection pad in the middle of the closure, as is the case with an adhesive bandage.  (It also does not have adhesive across the middle, of course, so as not to get adhesive in the wound.)You will notice, perhaps, that it is not even called a bandage, but a closure. There is a reason for this. It is designed help hold a laceration closed.  It is used to apply tension from either end of the closure toward the middle across a laceration to help hold the laceration together while healing.  It is applied at a right angle to the length of the laceration, in the direction that a surgical stitch would be applied, and is used for a similar purpose as a surgical stitch on wounds that are more than superficial but not serious enough to require stitches.  Longer lacerations may require more than one closure, applied in parallel to the laceration.  In addition to these closures, such lacerations should then also be covered using a large bandage, as should most simple scrapes and wounds,  to prevent introduction of bacteria while healing (and they too should be re-cleaned, re-dressed, and checked for infection as appropriate).Regarding Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages in general, and its butterfly closures in particular: Band-Aid products are some of the best adhesive bandage products on the market.  I am not affiliated with Johnson & Johnson except as a consumer.  However, since I somewhat frequently rely on these closures to avoid the need for stitches and since, in my opinion, their brand is the best butterfly closure on the market, I wanted to do my best to set the record straight regarding this product.Further information regarding wound care:  By the way, because it sounds like you might be attempting to apply bandages to wounds on which the bleeding might not yet have slowed, you also might be interested in researching how to apply mild compression to a wound for a few minutes in order to slow, if not stop, the bleeding in order to allow for a more successful bandage application.  In addition, the skin to which the adhesive of the bandage must stick should be dry in order to obtain the best adhesion. Further, the bandage should be re-applied if it has gotten wet, such as during hand-washing, etc.Of course, as you mentioned, one can also rely on gauze pads with first aid tape.In closing, please accept my sincere hope for better experiences and outcomes during wound care for both you and your family members.",5.0,This product works great; please disregard the negative reviews from one man with an ax to grind about Band-Aids,1349049600.0,"10 1, 2012"

A1MP5ZMAFXBJR1,B00H3OYSHW,juancarlos olivares,"[2, 3]","The New Trent Airbender Pro is a case that I would recommend to just about anyone, that does not mind adding a little weight to their iPad.  The case comes in two parts.  One part keyboard and one part all enclosing case with screen protector.The case that covers the back of the iPad and the screen is very well made.  I feel that my iPad is safer with the case than without the case.  It could probably be dropped a little with little to no damage to the iPad.  The screen protector, which is attached to the case, also covers the display along with the front facing camera well.  Alongside the screen protector is a rubber border, which also extends to the back, that protects the iPad if dropped face down.  In that case the border would take the impact.  This is more seen on cell phones.As far as the keyboard goes, it is roomy enough and it gets the job done.  I am actually writing this review using the keyboard.  The keys click and are responsive to the touch.  And I feel comfortable using it for more than a brief period.Now onto my concerns.  As stated above this is a really good product.  That being said, no product is perfect and the following I feel is something that a potential buyer should be aware of.-The screen protector has a kind of rainbow effect when the screen is not on.+This is not noticeable when the iPad is on.-The screen protector makes iPad more reflective than without having it on.+This was more of a problem playing games than watching videos.-The keyboard has a plastic flap, used to latch onto the iPad part of the case preventing it from coming open, right below the space bar.  The flap folds up so that when you are typing on the keyboard your right hand thumb will hit the flap while typing.+This is actually a little bit more annoying.Overall I would rate the New Trent Airbender Pro a solid 4 out of 5.  If I was rating the screen case alone it would be a 4.5 and the keyboard a 3.5.",4.0,A good affordable case that protects and adds more functionality.,1392163200.0,"02 12, 2014"

The reason I am giving this book 5 stars is because not only was the story engaging, but it was fast paced and I could identify with one of the main characters, Steve. Like him, I was upset with Western Medicine and how I felt and sometimes do still feel dismissed. It was in Eastern medicine combined with Western medicine that I found many of my issues able to be controlled. One of the main things in the book when Steve does something to his doctors that many may find reprehensible is to get them to both realize that one needs to ""marry both types of medicine together"". I could not agree more.The only thing I found about this book that bugged me was at the end when the author describes Steve and Paul's childhood adventures in a specific location. I thought this information could have been scattered throughout the book but it was not enough for me to drop a star of my rating. The ending chapter was a nice ending and a surprise ending at the best. I did not see it coming and honestly, many readers may not see it coming.This book is staying on my Kindle to be read again if I meet my challenge goals before the end of 2012.

A3T8Y73DOFUIR6,079215455X,S. Smith-Peter,"[2, 2]","Set in the Texas Panhandle during Woodrow Wilson's presidency, the film technically is about a love triangle between Bill (Richard Gere) Abby (Brooke Adams) and a rich farmer (Sam Shepard).  Bill and Abby, who are traveling along with Bill's sister, Linda (Linda Manz), pretend to be brother and sister but are really lovers.  Things go fine until the farmer is taken with Abby.What strikes me is that nature is really the subject of the film, particularly in the first half. The characters are almost entirely outside.  Heaven in this part deals with the heavens, the skies, as we see many shots of people backlit against a vast sky.  Bill and Abby even sleep out in the hay when it snows.  Their relationship, although it provokes some taunting by fellow migrant workers, isn't presented as fundamentally problematic.  They're living in a state of nature.Then, however, Bill convinces Abby to let the farmer court and marry her.  A key scene is where Bill enters the farmer's house, which has up until then been a looming presence on the horizon, but not an interior experience.  Now Bill has entered into a new world and is no longer in a state of nature.  Here is where Linda comes into her own.  She finally has a place and doesn't have to work all the time and is learning quite a bit from the farmer.  But Richard Gere has to come back and mess it all up (like he has many a movie).  His second return sets in motion the tragedy the experienced viewer has been expecting, and the emotional detonation is intense.I don't understand why so many people complained about the emotional minimalism.  Frankly I found it a relief to not have to have every turn explained, foreshadowed, and repeated again and again. Everything was implied rather than stated.  That shows respect for the viewer rather than any lack of mastery.",5.0,Beautiful meditation on nature and humanity,1293321600.0,"12 26, 2010"

A1X69RZ08LRNGL,B004N625AK,steve_oakland,"[2, 2]","This is a good router, optimized for people who like out-of-the-box functionality. It's preconfigured to work and get up and running quickly once you install a bit of software. I installed this router for my parents so they could give it a try. The wireless-N range is EXCELLENT: as I could get a strong signal through several walls and > 150 feet away. This was a nice improvement as it facilitated working at more locations around their house.PROS:1. If you are not picky about settings and have a simple home network setup, this works more or less right out of the box. A real random password is pre-configured, so you don't even have to worry about changing or setting the security yourself if you don't want to. This is better than setting no security at all, which a lot of people do given how common it is to find unsecured WiFi networks in many areas. A handy card can be stored underneath the router so in case you forget your network name or password, it is right where you need it.CONS:1. I'm not keen on having to install special software to configure the router. The packaged software was quite slow to install on my Macbook. Beyond basic features, the advanced features must be programmed in by a web interface by typing in the IP address of the router into your browser. If that's the case, why even have the installation and configuration software?2. While the default settings were easy to navigate, setting up advanced settings and changing the password wasn't necessarily easy. As mentioned, advanced settings must be changed via a browser interface, and there is nothing of a step-by-step guide.

A2SYP4XQ853PSK,0816644888,"Caroline Nelson ""Muffy""","[0, 0]","Multicultural Politics is a VERY worthwhile read. Modood challenges traditional conceptions of identity and racism by exploring the experience of South Asian Muslims in Britain. He seeks to achieve an understanding of society that is ""anchored in the comprehension of agents themselves.""  The most persistent voice is his own, which infuses his arguments with the passion of a child whose ""privileged middle-class life"" in Pakistan was disrupted by his family's immigration to Britain in 1961.After analyzing ethnic statistics in Britain, Modood argues that the divide is not a black-white divide but ""a divide between white, Chinese, African Asian, and Indian men on the one hand, and Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Caribbean men on the other.""  Referencing the 20% of whites under 35 who admitted to being prejudiced against Asians in the 1986 Survey Report,  Modood argues that this prejudice is primarily against Muslims and that ""cultural racism"" exists in tandem with and often as a second step to ""color racism.""  While a quarter of whites attend a place of worship at least once a month, two-thirds of Muslims attend at least once a week.  These statistics form the basis of Modood's claim that the movement to eliminate color racism excluded Asians by lumping them into the ""black"" category with which they could not identify.""In locating oneself within a hostile society,"" Modood writes, ""one must begin with one's mode of being, not one's mode of oppression.""  Modood cites evidence of Britain's ""hostile society"" in the BNP,  adverse immigration laws,  and ""Paki-bashing"" in the police force  when Muslims confront the highest level of attacks on person and property.  He also alleges discrimination against Muslims in education and employment. Muslims are underrepresented in prestigious jobs,  and a BBC Radio experiment discovered that identical CVs submitted to 50 firms yielded interviews for 23% of applicants with white names compared to 9% with Muslim names.  Modood also points to indirect discrimination that favors locals, requires work on Friday's, or frowns upon Muslim dress.  However, he rejects Rex's theory that ethnicity is artificially determined by group conflict  and Smith's theory that it is formed by resistance to oppression.  Ethnicity is not, as Miles contends, a ""false doctrine""  and it is not ""voluntary,"" as Banton suggests. Modood asserts that real collectivities exist, and defines them through five dimensions, including ""cultural distinctiveness"" and ""identity.""He extends this analysis by arguing for a ""state policy of multiculturalism"" that views the country as more than a liberal association of autonomous individuals.  He asserts the ""positive right"" of minorities to ""share in the public domain, including law, in order to live by communal values even where those values run counter to majority values and lifestyles.""  While criticizing the effective ""establishment"" of Anglicanism in the British constitution,  he argues that radical secularism also privileges the dominant ethnic group by forcing minorities to follow its normative legal ideal.  Instead he proposes a ""plural state,"" which recognizes both communities and individuals as actors and gives the former ""a formal representation or administrative role"" to play in the state, thereby offering a holistic emotional identity.Modood's proposal fails to take Islam's pluralism into account. The very act of ""institutionalizing some public space for religions""  runs contrary to his fluid concept of identity. Modood asserts that he does not believe in ""discrete, bounded populations of cultural absolutes""  and expects a group to ""change, develop, adopt, borrow, and synthesize"".  His proposal would marginalize minorities within Islam by creating a formal dialogue in the public sphere. Who will represent the Shi'a? Who will represent the 50% of Muslims who do not approve of state-funding for parochial schools or the youth who continue to identify with Islam without speaking South Asian languages, attending a mosque, or having arranged marriages?A second cause for concern lies in Modood's definition of incitement to religious hatred. He compares the statement ""Jesus Christ was a homosexual"" with ""Prophet Muhammad was a lewd, dishonest, dissembling power seeker"" and concludes that the former is permissible but that the latter isn't because it criticizes a belief that is ""part of the primary self-identification of a group.""  By forcing speech to contribute to ""constructive dialogue,""  Modood places speech under subjective control. This act is a slippery slope to stifling academic inquiry. The ability of subversives within a religion to challenge the ascendant interpretation is essential to its fluid identity. Like his call for a ""plural state,"" restricting offensive speech hardens the boundaries of identity that Modood ostensibly prefers remain ""soft.""",4.0,Food for Thought--but riddled with inconsistencies,1138752000.0,"02 1, 2006"

Meanwhile, Amy's friend, Jenelle, suspects that her boyfriend, Anderson, might be breaking up with her, since he's spending so much time with Kiwi, and Michiko still won't admit to Amy that she has a crush on Amy's older brother, even though all the signs are there.Fiona, on the other hand, seems to be losing her place in ""The League"" of popular girls to Lucia, her old second-in-command whose prank drove the wedge between Amy and Fiona, and Amy doesn't know if she should feel sorry for Fiona or pleased that she is finally getting what she deserves.Amidst all this, Preston keeps pestering Amy about joining the committee for planning the seventh grade prank, and Amy is hesitant to do so. However, she realizes that Preston does not seem nearly as annoying as he used to, and she doesn't know how she should feel about that, either. While her crush, the eighth grader Scott, keeps giving her mixed signals, Amy wishes that, for once, boys and girls could just be honest with each other and clearly let others know how they feel. But her genuine wish could spell disaster for her friendships, all of which seem to be teetering on the brink of madness. It's anyone's guess how this Crazy Week will end, but it's obvious that nothing will ever be the same again once the school year is over.A fine end to a fine series, one can appreciate Amy's level-headed approach to relationships, as well as her struggle to navigate her way through this emotional end of the year for the seventh graders of Allington Academy.Reviewed by:  Allison Fraclose",5.0,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,1287014400.0,"10 14, 2010"

So, I wrapped the tube ends in paper towel and tied it up with some metal wire and put a piece of cardboard on top of my graphics card, just in case.  Installation was easy, cleaning off/applying more thermal paste was cake, and now my CPU clocks to 4.5ghz and is staying around 60C, which is plenty low for haswell chips.  So far, this has saved me from needing to delid the CPU to get the clock speed I wanted.  The pump is quiet, when my case fans are on low, the whole computer is nearly silent.  The loudest thing is the 7950 graphics card, and even it is extremely manageable.TL;DR:  I was worried about it leaking after reading some reviews, wrapped the tube ends in paper towel just in case, and have had no problems in the 3 months I've had it.

The Tiffany jewelry, chandeliers, blowing white curtains and winding staircase are the stuff of imagination.  The twenties at their peak.  The acting however, and the screenplay failed to fulfill this magnificent book.  De Caprio is not Redford; for the better part of the movie he sounds as though he is trying to speak like a Kennedy.  He finally comes into the character in the last scenes, and in those, is really good.  Toby McGuire is vacant; without the writing tool used in the movie he has no personality at all.  Carey Mulligan is a picture of Daisy; the depth of character and beginnings of her madness are not there.  She never has those 'Zelda'  moments which gave meaning to her part in the story.  The best character in this version is Jordan; Isla Fischer is beautiful and conveys her character, the times, everything with only few words; in her facial expression and movement there is a true depth that draws attention.  Found myself wanting to hear more from her.  The story is lost.  There is no mention or appearance of Daisy's child at all until the last; one is left wondering where she came from and when, unless you know the book.  The best part of the screenplay is the use of Fitzgerald's amazing closing lines and the green light......

A25WS09GRNHWCP,8861303439,Claudia,"[15, 18]","Due to the very good reviews on Amazon and because this book says to be a glimpse of the exhibition on Grace Kelly in Monaco (I was unfortunate not being able to visit), I bought this book. As already mentioned by others, it does have a very nice and high quality look and feel, but still, it did not meet my expectations. Being a Grace Kelly Fan, I am sort of disappointed to find many pictures one can already find in many other publications on her. The personal items are very interesting, but there could be more.This book is officially accepted by her family, and it is quite understandable that the image of Grace Kelly had to be a positive one, just like she had wished, as one of her quotes in this book states. But another of her quotes also shows, that she did not seem consistently happy with her fairy tale image, to which she herself had some cause. Is this maybe a glimpse of one extreme in her personality? I think it would have been possible to show more of a ""real"" person, and maybe the exhibition this book is reflecting did so. If so, this book was not made with care.I have read some unauthorized biographies on her and even if they sometimes seem a little too much, too dirty, too revealing, they still appear to describe the life of a human, the ups and downs, the possible reasons for the choices made in life. This book is the absolute contrary, and even seems to be desperately trying to disprove all other books written on her. One example: one nice, short thank you letter from Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis makes the impression of a harmonious friendship. Other biographies claim their relationship to being quite disturbed, Jacqueline not at all being fond of Princess Grace. Well, maybe the exhibition had more to tell on this issue, so I would have rather seen more letters Grace Kelly wrote than thank you notes from her co actors and other celebrities written with typing machines.Maybe it would have been better just to display as many pictures as possible from the exhibition, with very little text and without any tendentious comments. This would have let the book be more open and would have let the spectator make up his own mind.

A2Q7K78QZEF23U,1557785163,Ravi Ravi,"[7, 67]","I am not sure how to judge this book. Being from India, everything that I know about Islam contradicts this book. Is it another WMD lie but this time by a scholar rather than a government? As I was getting ready to write my comments about this book, I came across another suicide bombing in Iraq leaving over 60 civilians dead. The images of victims, in my opinion, stand a witness that this book is a well intentioned deception. I think seeing is still believing, and what we see today, as well as what history shows us, is that this book is a lie. If this is indeed true Islam, then Islam is best kept secret even to Moslems.Of course, I must say that most of our experiences have been with what we know as Sunni Islam. I did not know anything about Shia version of Islam. Is this book portraying Shia version or Sunni version?  I must say, that I am amazed at the self restraint that Shia is demonstrating in face of their brutal Sunni counter part. If Moslems in India pulled the kind of crap they are pulling in Iraq against the majority, you better believe it there will be massacre in the streets. Imagine if a minority such as Mormons, or Moslems in the US were killing people the way Sunnis are killing Shia in Iraq, I wonder what the response would be from the majority. Do you think we would respond in the same manner as Shia in Iraq? I don't think so. Most probably majority would eradicate this savage population or gather them up all in a camp of some sort. These Shia in Iraq are putting even the most pacifist Buddhists to shame.So if this book is about Sunni Islam, I am not sure if I can buy the claims, too good to be true. Neither the history of Islam confirms this picture nor what we see today on a day to day basis and I am sure the author knows this fact all darn too well.  However if it portrays Shia Islam then maybe it is true I do not know much about Shia version of Islam but from what I see in Iraq they are either too stupid or much too peaceful.At any rate, read this book with suspicion as the available data indicates it is another weapons of mass deception.",3.0,A deception?,1151712000.0,"07 1, 2006"

How wrong I was and how glad I finally found the urge to watch.  True, the story on the face of it is a very simple one (and true) about an old age pensioner from New Zealand who finally realizes his dream to head to Bonneville Salt Flats and find out just how fast he and his motorcycle can go after years of tinkering with it in the shed where he lives in suburbia - but it's the journey that reveals more about the man than the destination itself.At home, his existence is slow and made up of routine (not least, peeing on his lemon tree each day..), and the slowness of his movements as an old man is contrasted with the speed that he dreams of on his bike (The Indian of the title).  As he starts off on his journey we really get a feel for what a transparently nice guy he is, interacting with some random Americans along the way and the movie unabashedly supporting the idea of ""Do as you would be done unto"".  His openness, pragmatic, accepting and trusting nature with a twinkle of mischief winning people inexorably over.. To be fair, it could all be a bit too much niceness and not enough actually happening, but director Roger Donaldson somehow pulls off a hat trick that works if you let it.With a tone reminiscent of the road trip in Middle America ofThe Straight Story, or the unpretentiousness ofThe Dish, this is less excitement, and more slow burn character piece, and as such the success of the movie lies mostly on the shoulders of Anthony Hopkins, in what turns out to be unexpectedly perfect casting.  His accent might be all over the place, but he has nailed the voice of this character's soul perfectly.Photography does justice to both the home scenes in New Zealand, as well as to the expanse of the Bonneville flats in Utah we see towards the end, but it's not the technical details that make this a treat - it's simply that the movies heart is absolutely in the right place.9/10",5.0,"Feel good road trip movie with heart, petrol and a dash of nitro.",1367020800.0,"04 27, 2013"

The book deals with a four month trip around a fascinating, enormous country, and besides reading what Paul did on most days - as in a journal entry, the reader learns that he spent a great deal of his time on the beach swimming, sleeping, eating and then at night, drinking beer! Occasionally one catches a glimpse of the real Paul, a shy man who is frightened of women, is bitter about his ex wife and who would rather smile than confront people who treat him badly. Proofreading would have helped too as there were many grammatical and punctuation errors -perhaps typos - but they irritated me.Would I recommend this book?

My two complaints are that there was no 9V  battery included as stated in the product description, and a big plus would be for the display and buttons to light up. Other than that, it is accurate, easy to attach and lock the stable cradle, and a great value at this price. Did I overlook a battery in the packaging anyone? I confirmed accuracy as I weighed him right before going to the vet who weighed him as well, and it matched.Edit: On further use I was frustrated as my healthy cat was lounging again in the cradle and thought that would be a good time to weigh her. What could be more accurate and convenient than a cat *lounging* in the cradle when you want to weigh it? See pic in the image section to see her on it. Well, with her on it and turning it on you have to zero it first. if you do that with her on it she will weigh zero lbs or kg! What am I missing here? Guess i could take her off the scale and get a negative reading? I will read the booklet again and if it's not possible to weigh properly with the cat already on the scale I may have to remove a star even though this scale is primarily marketed for baby and toddler use. With cats you have to take advantage of opportunity. Not every cat is such a great patient so for cat use my rating would be three stars.Hope to get some feedback on the battery situation and how to properly weigh with the cat already in the cradle.",4.0,Very good value and sturdy.,1280620800.0,"08 1, 2010"

A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0001JXOUS,Wuchak,"[2, 4]","""The Last Samurai"" is a story about a Civil War veteran who goes over to Japan to fight the last pocket of Samurai; he is taken captive by the Samurai, but eventually learns to respect this dying culture and adapt to their way of life.WHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at; the cinemtography is magnificent. The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from ""Dances With Wolves,"" a very superior film. One could also cite ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Last of the Dogmen"" as films with similar plots. (Although ""Dogmen"" is basically a rip-off of ""Dances With Wolves,"" the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in ""Samurai"" where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in ""Dogmen"" wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from ""The Last of the Mohicans.""BOTTOM LINE: Although ""The Last Samurai"" could be subtitled ""Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,"" it's still quite enjoyable. People who have not seen these other four movies that so-obviously influenced ""Samurai"" will likely rate ""The Last Samurai"" higher than I have. If you really like this film and haven't seen these other movies I've mentioned, I encourage you to pick 'em up ASAP -- especially ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period.",3.0,"Likable, but Lacks Originality",1115596800.0,"05 9, 2005"

This book presents 49 articles that show how anthropological training can be applied to solve problems all over the world, from remote jungle villages to American corporations.  I originally purchased this book for use as a supplementary textbook in an introductory Anthropology class, but we only read about half a dozen of the articles.  But I liked the book and wanted to read more.  So now post-graduation I have finally had time to read the entire book.  What I like about it is the breadth of its subject matter.  It pretty much touches upon every aspect of anthropology and there are constant surprises.  Some subjects interest me more than others, so some of the articles were more enjoyable than others.  My favorites were the articles dealing with archaeology and forensic medicine.  The ones I did not like were the political ones in which the authors grind their personal axes.  Some of these were poorly argued, cherry-picking examples while conveniently ignoring contrary evidence.  But I can see their value in provoking classroom discussion.  I would estimate that about ten percent of the book is leftist propaganda, which is relatively small in today's anthropological teaching milieu in America.  A couple of the articles were obviously written by women who hate men so much that they don't even try to mask their misandry.  Another criticism is that some of the articles were already somewhat dated when this edition came out in 2006.  21st Century society changes at a breakneck pace.  In 2006, ""social networks"" were a teenage phenomenon.  Today the average age of Facebook users is well over 40.  This book may be really obsolete now.  There is a new edition of this book, but many professors (like the one I had) prefer older editions that they are familiar with.  In general, I think the book is worthwhile, despite about half a dozen truly expendable articles.  I'd give this book three and a half stars, rounded up to four.",4.0,Basically worthwhile,1380153600.0,"09 26, 2013"

That is quite uncommon for such a beautiful voice of this timbre.  Now if there were indeed a tenor with a dark voice who could tackle such material and do just about anything that the operatic repertoire requires of him, yet maintain a limber quality about his voice when tackling the challenging bel canto repertoire, then we would have Callas reincarnated in the tenor voice (LOL!!).  But truly, this is a gem of a recital.  No other tenor nowadays can perform such challenging material without resorting to unconventional means of singing.  He truly revived the real bel canto voice--fresh, light, yet invigorating in drama.  Drama, I say, is exemplified here not through the typical verismo style we are acquainted to nowadays.  It is rather inflicted upon the soul in the traditional bel canto manner--through embellishments and dramatic singing without sobs or such and so.  He does it with grace.  His florid lines will astound, amaze, and astonish you. His high notes are chesty yet beautiful.

A350TT4A1LNNHY,B00AKIPAG6,B. McDonald,"[22, 29]","""Unconditional"" is an incredibly moving film. It reminded me in several spots of ""Pay It Forward."" The story packs so many emotional scenes and so much drama that I'm tempted to call it manipulative; but I suppose to be fair, every film is ""manipulating"" the viewer in some way. That's the whole point - delivering messages and endeavoring to elicit an emotional response of some kind from the viewer. So again, this film is powerful. The scenes have been put together very well. The directing is strong. The music is fitting and excellent. The acting, especially by the two main characters (Joe and Sam, played by Michael Ealy and Lynn Collins respectively), is really well done. Collins is particularly good.This film bears no Christian labels (of which I'm aware), which is no surprise since Jesus is never mentioned in it. Nevertheless, it seems to masquerade as a Christian film, so I intend to address it from a Christian perspective. (As a Christian, I can't address it from any other perspective anyway.) The story is compelling, even if far-fetched in a few spots. Unfortunately, like the children's stories Sam writes, the message of this film is fantasy. What I mean by that is it is heartbreakingly incomplete. The deep messages that come out of the film are these:1. God loves you.2. You just need to realize it and accept it, and it will change your life.I agree with the first message. God indeed loves everyone. I do not agree with the second message. If we're going to talk about God, then we need to go to the authority on God, which is His Word, the Bible. Looking at the totality of scripture, it is blatantly obvious that the purpose of this brief, human existence is to make sure you enter into eternal life when you leave life here. The Bible is quite clear as to how a person does this. In John 17:3, Jesus said, ""This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."" So there's something very important about knowing Jesus Christ. In John 3, Jesus said, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."" And lastly, Romans 10:9 says, ""If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.""The Bible is extremely clear then that entering into eternal life (""going to heaven"" or ""being saved,"" etc.) requires knowing Jesus Christ, being born again, and making Jesus lord. All of these things have their roots in faith, believing things God has revealed to us. ""Unconditional"" doesn't say anything about being born again or about making Jesus lord. However, the film tells us that knowing God just happens if we seek Him. While this can indeed occur, what is missing throughout this film is the most critical piece: Jesus Christ. God has chosen to reveal Himself through His Son (Hebrews 1:1-4). He has chosen to make salvation available only through His Son (John 14:6, Acts 4:11-12). The fact that God loves you is not enough for you to enter eternal life. For a person to realize and accept God's love for them is not enough to enter eternal life. A person must be born again in order to receive the free gift of eternal life.There was a time in my life that I didn't want to live. I never found myself in a rainy alley with a loaded gun under my chin, but I relate to Sam's pain. And as in the film, God's providence placed individuals in my life who told me of His love and pointed me in a new direction. I sought after God for a year and a half, and I managed to change my life in some positive ways. Some of the pain of my past seemed to fade away. However, time and good works and intentions do not heal wounds. They may seem to heal, but they merely submerge in our souls, only to pop back up to surprise us by their enduring strength. Only Jesus Christ heals wounds of the human soul. Only Jesus liberates people from the bondage known as sin. Jesus said that ""everyone who sins is a slave to sin"" (John 8:34), and He effectively covered all mankind with that statement. Sin is without question mankind's greatest problem, and in sending Jesus Christ to set people free from sin, God has met humanity's greatest need. That is the very height of love. When I finally surrendered my life fully to Jesus Christ (made Him lord), believing in all He had done for me, I was born again. I was set free from the penalty for my sin (hell) and from the power of my sin to control my life. From that day, my life has never been the same. I received the free gift of eternal life. I entered God's kingdom (Colossians 1:13-14).That is the message of hope which is grievously missing from ""Unconditional."" Helping a stranger is noble. Feeding, clothing, and educating at-risk children is noble too and can bring about some positive change in the world, at least in the eyes of man. But from God's perspective, if the name of God's salvation, Jesus Christ, the Hope of all mankind, is never mentioned; all that happens is helped, fed, clothed, and educated people never learn the way of salvation and go to hell. If all we do as Christians is meet people's earthly, temporary needs, we have failed. If all we do is tell people that God loves them and will change their lives if they will accept His love, we have failed. We have failed them and God. Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, the exact representation of the Father (Hebrews 1:3), said, ""You must be born again"" (John 3:7). Does anyone have the right to change what God has decreed? No matter how moving it may be, is ""Unconditional"" a great film if it changes the good news of Jesus Christ? If it omits the good news of Jesus Christ? No. This film is hard for me to dislike because it has such potential. It could have been monumental in its impact for Christ and eternity. Instead, it falls short. Rather than leading people to eternal life, ""Unconditional"" deceives people and will likely comfort many with false hope, while they continue on a path toward hell. This is a lamentable summary of the film, but it is factual, and it is frighteningly common today.Given the quality of the film's production and the power of its messages (which will draw people into error), I advise against watching it due to the grievous omission of the saving gospel of Jesus Christ.",1.0,Another Missing Gospel,1385683200.0,"11 29, 2013"

I will caveat this assertion with my concern that durability may become an issue rather quickly, depending on use.As mentioned in the review title, I bought this &#34;Display Book&#34; with an alternate purpose in mind; to use as a sort of portfolio, to store, transport, and I was hoping, to be able to display 11x17 photo and digital art prints. Unfortunately, the easel doesn't stand well on its own when not completely full to facilitate balance, or if using different weights of card-stock or photo paper. The internal liner pockets are fairly thin and don't offer enough rigidity to provide adequate protection, when attempting to flip the pages, while utilizing thinner grade photo paper.Overall, the quality of the product is good (especially for the price), and many other reviewers have provided testimonials to its usefulness for presentations. I wanted to share my experience because, at the time of this review, there are not a large number of cost-effective options available for 11x17 photo/print display and storage.

A22Q3DG4CHS4JA,B002VKE0XA,"Jelly Jar ""Granny""","[12, 17]","I saw this in the wonderful Moolah Theatre in beautiful downtown St. Louis, MO. To start with, the awesome speaker system there did nothing for the terrible sound quality of the movie. They may have wanted it to sound more like the filming was being done by a camcorder, but gritty muffling throughout did nothing but detract from the entire experience.Another reviewer alluded to this movie as having the type of appeal that would attract eight-year-olds or those with eight-year-old intelligence levels (using much more degrading words, of course.) I wouldn't necessarily agree with that notion. On the contrary, the eight-year-olds and teenagers were the ones who were LAUGHING in the theater. NOBODY screamed until the last ten seconds.The bore factor here was incredible. Time crawled by while two shallow characters, Micah and what's-her-name, dealt with a supernatural entity that was never seen. Hey, it's okay to not show the demon; I understand that that's supposed to be part of the fear factor, but saving the best part of the movie for the extreme end when it could have been introduced as a foundation early on and then built upon for additional scares was a HUGE golden opportunity missed by everyone involved. But that's not all as far as missed opportunities go...the whole thing with the psychic, or whatever that character was supposed to be, was flawed and underdeveloped. That individual situation could have been expanded upon to create a whole different angle and level to the movie.So why all the hype, you ask? I have two theories. It may be one or the other, but its most likely a combination of both:1. Exceptional marketing, whether deceiving or not! 'Nuff said.2. When horror is presented in such a way that it is less about the grandiose, over-the-top, literally unbelievable, Hollywood presentation like ""Poltergeist,"" for instance, and more about something that is so subtle that it could actually happen to ""YOU,"" it opens the door for personal fears to creep through and subject the subconscious to a taste of a not-impossible reality.That being said, I give the movie and its makers three stars for effort, but keep in mind viewers, MOST of this movie is VERY boring.Three Stars ***",3.0,"Don't believe the hype!

It was written as a prediction of the future direction of American and western society - especially as regards the attitude to children and childhood but what comes across reading it 30 years later is a snapshot the late seventies.  As such this book can be little more than a curiosity now but what a curious one it is. The problem with making largescale predictions is that it is impossible to know what lies ahead.  Postman could not see, for example, Harry Potter, Japanese Manga, the internet, facebook or texting.  He could not have imagine the rise of China or a world where children's literature (books written for kids) was the most profitable sector of the global book market.Postman is a conservative and a reactionary who privileges a specific type of literacy (the reading of the right kinds of books) over other equally valid literacies.  Childhood under Postman's definition is not something that happened to kids in Africa or Asia or pre-colonial America and Australia it is a Europen phenomena tied to the fortunes of the printing press and therefore in great danger in our digital world.  What nonsense.  Childhood is much more robust than Postman gives it credit.  It also exists in many more places.The most compelling reason to read this book is in it Postman exposes the right wing origins of such contemporary phenomena as the Let Kids Be Kids movement and a conservative political scene which places the interests of Families over the interests of Citizens.  Postman's analysis of the dangers of TV and the early sexualisation of children has gone someway to dampen down my worries over these things.  I am less opposed to censorship now than I was before I read this book.  Childhood is a wonderful thing, and my own childhood was truly wonderful, but when it becomes the toll of idealogues or a prison for moulding a certain type of people then its day is done.",2.0,The kids are alright!,1317168000.0,"09 28, 2011"

As Luc Sante remarked, Sean Howe is to Marvel Comics what Procopius was the Byzantine Empire, which is apt considering the Byzantine creative processes at the company.  Marvel in its three major phases of development--early with Lee/Kirby, the middle years culminating in the Shooterverse, and the later years of boom/bust and resurrection as Marvel Films, are all covered in a loving, if bland, telling.  Maybe blandness is what passes for objectivity, as the history is told from different perspectives, and memories change over the years.While context and history are alluded to from time to time, like Marvel heroes and Vietnam, or the Comic Code Authority, a more general treatment of the company in publishing/media would have helped.  For example, we may know an issue was a blockbuster selling a couple hundred thousand copies, but how does that compare to other magazines, or rivals?  What about profit margins?  What about the economics of contracts, or reprints?  To be fair, many of these issues are touched upon, though anecdotally only, which is a source of charm, and a book thoroughly covering all these matters would have been immense.  As it is, this is clearly the work of a dedicated fan, and surveys the topics of concerns to fans, but necessarily limits the audience for the book somewhat for good or ill.The author has done a great job at this writing of continuing the journey of the book in social media like facebook, with updates, further or more elaborate anecdotes, and artwork--sort of like releasing a 'director's cut' over time of additional material and art, which is something that other books could do more to promote themselves and build their audience.The Untold Story is essential and recommended as a 'glimpse behind the curtain' for anybody who might have regarded themselves a fan of the Marvel Universe at any point in its history.",3.0,Telling the Untold Story,1355616000.0,"12 16, 2012"

If you are away for a week, it must run 24 hours a day for the entire week (unless you have someone there to manually unplug iTwin and put the machine to sleep for you). iTwin will not allow a computer to be put into sleep mode when it is plugged in and running.I had hoped to have a home computer automatically available to my son several hours each day for him to back his work up to while he is away at school. Easy to do by waking the machine from sleep mode at a certain time each day with a task set up in Windows Task Scheduler and then putting it back to sleep with a sleep setting in Windows Power Options (also requires a Power Options setting to Not require a password at wakeup.) As I said, easy to do. His home machine wakes up and goes back to sleep each day right on schedule UNLESS iTwin is plugged in. iTwin prevents the machine from going to sleep. I tried it on several different machines. Same result on every one. It did, however, allow all but one of the machines to wake up after I manually put them in sleep mode.I emailed iTwin helpdesk about this and basically they replied that iTwin is set up this way purposely because users don't remember to change their Power Settings to prevent their machines from going into sleep mode and then iTwin doesn't work for them. Further, they declined to consider giving users an option to disable the no sleep function. Apparantly they think we are idiots or just don't want to be bothered giving users options. Also, according to the reply I got from them, iTwin will prevent an automatic reboot if the machine gets an automatic update (for instance a Windows Security Update from Microsoft that requires a reboot) because a manual login is required at restart. Apparantly they don't think we are smart enough to set up our systems for automatic login - and again no consideration for any kind of a user option to disable.At the very least, iTwin's functionality is less than what it could be. If one only wants to use iTwin for short absences, it would be useful. However, for a longer absence, having a computer running contiuously just doesn't seem like a good idea to me. In addition, if a machine cannot make a necessary reboot for a security update, is it then left vulnerable to the object of that update?  It seems like that would defeat the purpose of automatic updates.Unfortunatly, Amazon's return period slipped away before I was able to try out the iTwin, so now it is mine.

A3M2KL2MMWHV3U,B0046M4H7K,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","For those of us who have been waiting for this Christmas album since we first heard Celtic Thunder; it is worth the wait!!  Each of the singers brings their own personalities to individual songs, like the power when you hear Paul sing Ava Maria or the fun Ryan has with Let It Snow, but the harmonies you have come to expect from Celtic Thunder shine through on the group numbers.  In my opinion, the version of Silent Night on the album is one of the best I have ever heard; Phil Coulter arrangement of the song is just amazing.  Neil makes a great addition to the group, brining another tenor in and allowing for even more complex harmonies than previously heard.  If you are a fan of Celtic Thunder, this album is one you need in your collection.  If you have never heard Celtic Thunder, this is an amazing album to start with.

The shoes do not have holes in them like most clogs of this style.  Not only does this make the shoes hotter because you don't get the air circulation of the others, but it allows for a certain suction to occur on your foot.  As you take a step, the suction is broken and a rather embrassing sound is emitted from the shoe as the air escapes around your foot.  The end result, it sounds like you are passing gas with every step!  I suppose if you only wear them in the garden this might be fine, but better hope nobody sneaks up on you!  I was also very disappointed in the comfort level of these shoes.  The insoles are quite hard feeling despite the fact that the shoes are extremely flexible.

AYCBX9P8SFKUH,1576733300,ruthlady,"[0, 0]","This work of fiction centers around four female friends of different ages. Naomi, Lucy, Rose and Gayle are in different stages of life and dealing with various circumstances and concerns. It is revealed in the story that the women have been friends for a long time and grew up in this small southern town.  Naomi feels that the four women have drifted apart and she thinks a `project' is just what they need to reconnect. An elderly woman named Grace is the project.This book is the second in a series, and I hadn't read the first book. Maybe that's why I didn't feel the women's characters were very well developed. There were times when I felt the interactions between the women were not believable. For instance, Naomi is referred to as the one who comes up with wild schemes and gets them all in trouble. In the case of Saving Grace the ""wild scheme"" is befriending the reclusive Grace Grayson-Wiley, inviting her to a children's play, and getting her back into society- GASP!The back story of the reclusive, elderly woman centers on an annual ball. When the woman was a young debutante her beau stood her up for the ball. Ever since then, she has dressed in the same ball gown and sat on her front porch on the anniversary of the ball. The details of their break up are not known, which is part of the mystery that surrounds her. The townspeople avoid her and refer to her as crazy. Maybe I just don't understand the southern culture, but I find this an exaggerated and extreme reaction to a quaint, slightly eccentric, yet otherwise normal, elderly lady.I just couldn't get attached to the women in this book. There were times when I felt like I was plowing through the pages; having said that, there is nothing objectionable about the content. Some older teen girls may enjoy the book, but I have reservations about how much they could relate to women with problems that include the worry of being an `old maid,' concerns of a husband wandering, romance after widowhood, and pregnancy at the age of forty.This is the kind of book I imagine as a good read on a vacation or road trip where intermittent reading could be enjoyed, as opposed to a riveting story where one cannot put the book down and a long uninterrupted weekend is called for.Note: I received this ebook from Multnomah Waterbrook Publishers in exchange for an honest review.",3.0,I could put this book down,1331596800.0,"03 13, 2012"

Going with the Cool Shaver a second time was an easy decision to make.However, the one problem I have is that liberating the shaver from the packaging was a major project.  It took a full ten minutes with fresh blade in my utility knife to complete the task.  Why is this necessary?  Is Norelco risking any liability in utilizing this packaging?

However, if you step up to the 30 plus dollar range (the price I paid), you step into another world of product.  Paying the extra you will get a concrete and noticeable difference in quality in and brightness.This light has 50 lumens at max brightness, 3 brightness levels, is waterproof, and just holding it, you can tell the quality of the product.  You simply don't get near this with a cheaper headlamp (I know, I own a few).

While O'Brien may have originally considered some of these takes inferior, to this listener there is no audible difference in musical quality whatsoever.  ""The Third Set"" is a highly enjoyable, swinging CD of bebop piano, with O'Brien backed superbly by bassist Ray Drummond and drummer Kenny Washington.The set opens with Howard McGhee's uptempo ""Double Talk"", and moves next  moves into a swinging  mid-tempo take of ""It Could Happen to You."" Then  O'Brien announces that ""We're going to do some Tadd Dameron now"", and leads the trio in no less than five Dameron compositions  including the well-known ""If You Could See Me Now"", the bluesy ""The Squirrel"", and the lesser known ""Dameronia."" As jazz buffs know, Dameron's compostions are quite beautiful, and  always provide fertile ground for swinging and inventive improvisation. Such is the case here. Dameron's music is meat and potatoes for this trio and brings out the best in all three musicians. O'Brien's stop-time segment in ""Our Delight"" will capture your attention and provide listening delight as it did for the audience at ""Blues Alley.""  The set and the evening ends gently with a reflective take of ""Easy Living.""Hod O'Brien is a master of bebop piano and on this 59 minute set gives us some of the most swinging, uplifting and satisfying modern jazz piano to be heard anywhere.

ANO3KSOXDYG2X,0066620694,Jennifer Ryan,"[30, 31]","Christensen clearly presents the reality of how disruptive technologies affect organizations. He reviews the business perspectives of large firms vs. those of small firms, and their issues with disruptive and sustaining  technologies, i.e., resources, profit margins, customers, etc. Christensen  explains that what to us, from the point of 20/20 hindsight, may now seem  like blatantly obvious organizational faux pas, at the time seemed like the  correct path for the organization to follow. He also reviews companies that  have been able to not only survive, but succeed with the emergence of  disruptive technologies.Disruptive Technologies vs. Sustaining  TechnologiesOne of the main reasons why great firms fail is that they  attempt to market and manage disruptive technologies utilizing the same  methodologies that are found to be successful for the management and  marketing of sustaining technologies. These firms are essentially held  captive by their customers, since this methodology is based on pleasing the  established customer base. Disruptive technologies often are intended for  different customer bases that may not have yet been discovered. Due to  this, disruptive technologies are often not seen as successful or  profitable by large firms that need to keep large profit margins. They are  instead seen as successful by smaller entrant organizations with smaller  profit margins.&quot;Resource Dependence - Customers effectively  control the patterns of resource allocation in well-run  companies&quot;Management, especially middle management, is very aware  of the customer base their company holds. Their customers are the ones who  keep pouring money back into their organization through the purchase of  products. These customers have set their expectation on the sustaining  technology the organization currently offers, as it helps them run their  business. They usually have little interest in a disruptive technology that  more than likely will not currently meet their needs. This, in turn, causes  any new projects involving disruptive technologies that are kept within the  same organization and held to the same profit expectations, which initially  they will no be able to meet, to not be held at the top of the  organizational priority list. The disruptive technology will be  &quot;shelved&quot; until it comes into the mainstream, and by that time it  may be too late.&quot;Small markets don't solve the growth needs of  large companies&quot;When a disruptive technology begins to make its  presence known, the disruptive technology needs to be viewed with serious  consideration. From this, proper planning for its many possibilities should  take place. These plans need to remain flexible, and development of the  disruptive technology should take place within a department, organization,  or subsidiary that has little financial bearing on the company as a whole.  This is the necessary environment for the successful development of a  disruptive technology. The larger organization can not expect this  disruptive technology to command the profit margins of the organization's  sustaining technologies until it has discovered its customer base.&quot;The ultimate uses or applications for disruptive technologies are  unknowable in advance. Failure is an intrinsic step toward  success.&quot;A great example from the book is the introduction of Honda  motorcycles in the U.S. in 1959. Initially Honda wanted to conquer the  American market with their 50cc Supercub bike, but their bikes weren't  built for running at high speeds for extended periods like Harley-Davidson  and BMW. Honda discovered, after failing to market the bikes as road bikes,  from actually watching how people used the bikes, that their bikes were  best suited for off road dirt biking, a sport that had not yet come to  fruition. Harley-Davidson attempted to take part of the new market, but  tried to do so by marketing this disruptive technology as a sustaining  technology. Their plan failed to prove profitable.&quot;Technology  supply may not equal market demand. The attributes that make disruptive  technologies unattractive in established markets often are the very ones  that constitute their greatest value in emerging markets.&quot;Honda was  able to do this by creating a new market segment, off road bikers! These  same bikes were not attractive to those customers interested in long haul  road bikes such as Harley-Davidson and BMW, but Honda's bikes now hold a  majority of the market.",4.0,Disruptive vs. Sustaining Technologies,947635200.0,"01 12, 2000"

A3NQSMTG612AF,0790733226,TheTruthHurts,"[9, 10]","Warning, this review contains spoilers...if you haven't yet watched it, don't continue on, but simply hear this; it is a masterpiece!  Forget renting it, find yourself a copy to own.This movie, at least as far as I am concerned, is Robert Zemeckis' best, even better than Back to the Future and Forrest Gump.  Let me begin by stating that if your IQ is lower than 100 (or 120 for that matter), you probably won't enjoy it.  Why?  There are indeed no ""aliens"" or ""monsters"" that jump out of the shadows, nor are there big men with big guns that blow them up and cheer ""go back to your home planet, you scum...America rules!!!""  This isn't Star Trek, nor is it your typical cornball ""sci-fi"" flick.  If it were, I wouldn't be reviewing it, because I wouldn't have seen it.  What this movie is is an amazing rendition of one of Carl Sagan's most enthralling and intelligent novels, and it is indeed a fine example of just how good a film based on a work of fiction can be.  What this piece is is a work of art; rather than stimulate our animalistic urges to see ""little green men"" pop out at us with ""plasma rifles,"" like most everything else that's come out of Hollywood since its inception, the ending of the film leaves it up to our imaginations, essentially, to decipher precisely what happened to Ellie (Dr. Elanaor Arroway, the protagonist) during her journey to the galaxy in which the star Vega is contained.  The beginning of this film alone, in which a three-plus minute digression from our planet through seemingly trillions of miles of the universe takes place, was enough to hook me.  This film is about not only the endless debate between religion and science, of which Ellie is a firm believer in the latter, but it is about her transformation, more or less, in the end of the film to someone just a little less skeptical...what Zemeckis (and obviously Sagan) was indeed trying to portray in the ending of this film is that there is reason to have ""faith"" in the future, even in these desolate times, and to show us that there just might be more than meets the eye to our existence...and that there may be more than we know, and/or are capable of knowing, to ourselves, our race, and each other and what each of us believes, especially in the face of having no tangible ""proof""...and finally that we are indeed never as ""alone"" as we all feel at one time or another.  A truly unique and masterful film, consistently underrated and panned by critics, most often for its inclusion of a certain ex-president in a couple video clips...give me a break.  Does that really detract from the quality and purpose of the film?  I think not, and to give the film lower marks for it is ludicrous, in my opinion.I am not a religious individual, and am in fact an agnostic.  I could easily envision overtly religious people loathing Jodie's character beginning with the scene of the death of her father, as she hastily denies the support of the religious figure(s) at her father's wake.  However, like I said earlier, the film is by no means out to deny the existence of God or debunk any religion, nor does it attempt to verify these concepts.  It is merely contrasting the two sides of the argument and makes valid points in favor of each.  So, my main point is that this film is so much more than a ""sci-fi"" film (to say that this film doesn't compare to Star Wars or Star Trek is quite absurd; they aren't even honestly in the same genre in the first place, and this film transcends any of that...stuff).  Just give it a chance, and if you disagree, so be it...but I know that it moved me like no other film had in quite some time, and I'm a better person for having seen it, and it remains one of my all-time favorite films, even eight years after its release.

So of course he thought it was getting to serious, so he faked his own death.Stole Beer From A Golfer-Earl has to put up with a golfer he took advantage of to get free beer by having him think he kept getting hole-in-ones. That made him obsessed with golf which lost him his job, dog, and girlfriend.

AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B003H8F43U,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[11, 12]","NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online; you can read a more complete copy of my review on that site.This DVD features Trudie Styler, wife of Sting, in a workout led by James D'Silva.  The setting for Pure Sculpt is Styler's and Sting's beautiful Tuscan villa; the workout segments are filmed either on an outdoor patio against gorgeous mountainous scenery or in a handsomely styled indoor marble area.  The music (as one might guess) is provided by Sting:  soft, instrumental selections from his Songs from the Labyrinth album.The basic design of this DVD is that there are six distinct workouts, each of approximately 10 minutes in length (actual times are below), which can be used either separately or together.  Sub-menus off the Main Menu allow you either to select individual workout chapters or to customize the chapters in any order.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:  Play All - Workouts - Custom Workout - Bonus Materials.  D'Silva instructs all of the routines via voiceover (note:  he does not mirror-cue) while both he and Styler perform the moves.  I have broken down each of the segments in detail below.Warm-Up (10 minutes)The majority of the warm-up is performed standing, with D'Silva strongly emphasizing cuing the breath as he leads a series of gentle, flowing stretches; towards the end of the warm-up, he moves to the floor for some brief work on all fours, down dog, and cobra.  Unfortunately, the music is a bit loud in this section, and because D'Silva is so soft-spoken, I sometimes had trouble hearing his instructions here.Core Conditioning Routine 1 (10 minutes)This floor segment is based on traditional crunch-type exercises, but D'Silva executes them in a slower, more deliberate pace throughout.  He includes both curl-ups and reverse crunches (hip raises), and he intersperses pelvic lifts, performed as a sort of stretch or rest in-between some of the other moves.  There are also some Pilates-like exercises, including leg circles and criss-cross.Core Conditioning Routine 2 (8.5 minutes)In this section, D'Silva incorporates even more Pilates-like moves, beginning with a variation on the Pilates roll-up in which he flows up and into a side stretch, first with the legs together, then with the legs apart.  This is followed by a version of the Pilates rollover/plow pose, made more advanced by keeping the arms overhead rather than by the sides for support.  D'Silva increases the difficulty level even further by instructing you to grab your ankles while in plow and roll forward; eventually, you are rolling from plow to a Pilates teaser position, a very advanced move.Lower Body Toning Routine 1 (12 minutes)For this segment, you will set up on the floor in a side-lying position and perform a series of movements emphasizing the hips/outer glutes.  D'Silva starts with a bent leg lift, but he moves through a long sequence of both bent and straight leg work, including tempo changes.  Influences of both the Pilates side kick series and ballet can be seen here.Lower Body Toning Routine 2 (12.5 minutes)This routine focuses more on the rear glutes.  D'Silva and Styler start in a face-down position, and D'Silva cues small pulsing movements, first with a single leg, then both legs.  Next comes about five minutes of leg lifts performed on hands and knees; you'll start with straight leg lifts, then move on to bent leg before switching to the other side.  For the final few minutes of this segment, D'Silva and Styler are in a kneeling position for side leg lifts.Pure Arms Routine 1 (9.5 minutes)In this segment, both Styler and D'Silva are wearing wrist weights.  D'Silva begins by warming up the shoulders with shoulder rolls and side delt raises.  He then continues with less traditional exercises (many have distinctive names such as ""waitress,"" ""engine,"" and ""disco arms""), keeping the arms in constant motion throughout the entire segment.Pure Arms Routine 2 (9.5 minutes)Styler and D'Silva are again wearing the wrist weights here, but Styler is also holding small dumbbells in her hands.  This segment is fairly similar to the one preceding it, and in fact it includes many of the same movements (e.g., waitress, engine arms).  However, you will also perform some more traditional upper body exercises, such as tricep extensions (although D'Silva cues these moves in a more flowing, continuous manner).I had a few problems with this DVD.  First, although there is a separate Warm-Up, there are no cool-down.  D'Silva does incorporate some stretches within each of the individual workout segments, but this is not sufficient.  The second issue is more significant.  I would rate the overall level of this DVD as being appropriate for low intermediate exercisers and above.  However, some of the exercises included in the second core segment are quite advanced--I consider myself to be a high intermediate exerciser, but I was reluctant to follow along for fear of injury.  No modifications are shown or suggested by D'Silva.This series of DVDs from Styler and D'Silva certainly has plenty of appeal--D'Silva is a competent, likable instructor, and both D'Silva and Styler are graceful and inspiring in their movements.  While Pure Sculpt offers some innovative and effective exercises, the difficulty level of some of the segments may limit its utility amongst home fitness enthusiasts; for this reason, my final rating is 3 1/2 stars.",4.0,"Mix & Match segments for Upper Body, Lower Body, and Core Work",1300060800.0,"03 14, 2011"

I have to change my cuff button from 2nd to 1st to leave room for it.  And it is definitely ""there"".  My last watch was a Casio a couple of mm thick and so it was almost not like wearing a watch, except the time was on my wrist.  I suspect I'll end up buying another one of those, but I'll give this one at least a couple of week's try to be fair.The setup and instructions are atrocious.  It's generic Timex, and it's not obvious which one this is.  Some have a two-position crown, some have a three-position crown.  After playing with the crown for a while, it seemed there were two positions.  But I couldn't change the date, except by spinning the dial forward 24 hours, which takes dozens of turns.  Imagine wanting to go forward a month.So I studied the watch under a bright light for a while until I found in 2-point font on the back a number, like a serial number, which was in fact the part number.  I went to the web, and from there deduced it actually was a 3-position crown.  So where was that third position?  Eventually I found it by very gently easing the crown out to the middle position.  It was easiest to do it with eyes closed, like picking a lock, to really feel the microscopic motion.  Even then it took a while to realize that the date could only be adjusted forward, not back.Since I had a reference clock to set the watch by, I know this  procedure took from 8:39 to 8:51, or 12 minutes.

They begin exchanging warm emails as she lives in Arizona.  He also considers coming out of retirement to work the California recall governor initiative though his memory of the odious Bushwhacking of the Cleland campaign in Georgia still leaves a bitter aftertaste.  However, first before he can regain his lost youth this Boomer needs to rid himself of Peg.This odd contemporary character study focuses on an aging eccentric boomer who lives comfortably, but regrets his major choices in life starting with Peg.  After meeting Valerie, he decides she is the person who will make the rest of his life worth living, but he understands he must rid himself of Peg.  An incredibly developed character somewhat at the expense of the overall plot, fans will not like George, but will empathize with his disappointments in himself that he manifests with his anxiety attacks and his projection of blaming Peg.

A23G50BB2EAJ99,0736924965,Editors at Lighthouse Trails Research Project,"[13, 48]","In the pages of Death by Church: Rescuing Jesus from His Followers, Recapturing God's Hope for His People (Harvest House, 2009), author Mike Erre (pastor of RockHarbor Church in Costa Mesa, California) acknowledges that Jesus is Lord. He also references a number of Scriptures and talks about several different Bible stories. But for the discerning Christian who knows his Bible, it doesn't take too long into Erre's book to realize something is amiss, and such a reader soon begins to have a sense that he is theologically being tossed to and fro between the pages of this book and soon feeling like he is in a battle zone for the truth. Sandwiched between the Scripture references and the mention of ""Jesus"" is a theology that does not at all represent the Gospel.Death by Church has a point to make--that God is saving ""all of creation"" (eg. p. 100) and that the ""church"" is not the substance of the kingdom of God (i.e., the whole of creation and all of humanity is). In fact, Erre says, the church is not the kingdom of God at all - it only points to the kingdom of God, which incorporates all of creation and, if the church does all the right things it can have the privilege of being part of that kingdom too. Erre seeks to prove his point but not just by turning to Scripture - he turns to prominent figures in the emerging/emergent church (those such as Brian McLaren and Dan Kimball), the contemplative mystical prayer movement (those such as Dallas Willard and panentheist Richard Rohr-a favorite of Erre's), and New Age sympathizers (those such as Marcus Borg, who believes Jesus did not see himself as the Son of God and Gregory Boyd, author of the not-yet published work, The Cosmic Dance). Couple Erre's frequent use of emerging/contemplative/New Age sympathizing authors with his kingdom-now theology wrapped in universalist/panentheistic overtones, and Death by Church actually takes on a pseudo-name, Death by Deception.",1.0,Death by Church a Great Deception,1243382400.0,"05 27, 2009"

A1K3YQH371UADK,B0028Y5SBM,Jimmy L.,"[3, 3]","This set is Part Two of the 12-part ""Secret Wars"" series.  Each set comes with a reprint of one of the twelve ""Secret Wars"" comic books and two action figures of characters featured in the comics.  The series celebrates the 70th anniversary of Marvel Comics and the 25th anniversary of the ""Secret Wars"" storyline, which saw superheroes from throughout the Marvel universe team up to fight the supervillains.  Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, etc., all in one story.Issue #2 comes with figures of the Human Torch and Wolverine.  The figures are much like the other recent figures in Hasbro's 3-3/4"" scale Marvel Universe line.  They are highly articulated, given their small size, with all the joints the other Marvel Universe figures have.  This makes them posable, but less durable.  Young children who play hard with their toys may have arms and legs falling off of these figures, especially the relatively frail Human Torch figure.The highlight of this set for me is the Human Torch, who is shown the way I always remember him: red and covered in flames.  The figure is red from head to toe, with some yellow flames added to his head and yellow flame designs painted on his body.  It's much better, in my opinion, than the other Human Torch figures out there, where it's Johnny Storm in his Fantastic Four uniform, only his hair is on fire.  I never liked that look.  Anyway, the figure feels rather delicate and comes with a flame accessory that attaches to its hand.The Wolverine figure comes in his '80s-era brown & orange (tan?) costume.  It's an entirely different figure than the similar retro-costumed figure from the X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE movie line.  This figure is actually bigger and has a completely different sculpt.  The movie figure had a wider mask and an ugly grimace on its face.  Its belt buckle had an ""X"" for ""X-Men"".  And the costume was a much darker orangy color.  This ""Secret Wars"" version has a simple stoic expression on its face and a traditional belt buckle.  The costume is more yellowy in color, and the brown is redder.  Wolverine's claws are attached to his hands, but made out of a rubberier plastic, so they might bend, but they shouldn't be dangerous.The comic book included is printed on a glossy magazine-type paper (as opposed to traditional ""comic book paper"") in full color, but the comics are usually bent out of shape inside the packaging.The Marvel Universe line is great because characters from throughout the Marvel mythos are available in simple 3-3/4"" figures designed from their well-known comic book appearances.  In the case of these ""Secret Wars"" figures, they are designed from their looks in the comic books included with them.  These 2-figure, 1-comic sets are nice for collectors.  Kids can enjoy them, too, and educate themselves on their heroes' past exploits.  But I have a feeling these toys wouldn't be as much ""fun"" as other products out there.  This is a good set, though, if you want the retro looks of the Human Torch and Wolverine.I was never a big comic book aficionado, but the ""Secret Wars"" series was a big deal in the Marvel universe.  Now a new generation can enjoy these classic stories and collect their favorite classic superheroes.",4.0,"Part Two of ""Secret Wars"" series; good for collectors",1256688000.0,"10 28, 2009"
AQKKK3WHCHJA1,B000001I0Q,T.B.,"[2, 2]","This is a review of the most recent (2013) CD release from &#34;Real Gone Music&#34; of The Lords Of The New Church's self titled debut album from 1982.First, a short bit about the album itself - This album was The Lords first album and is one of those rare debuts from an early 80's rock band that is a solid, great listen from start to finish.  Featuring former Dead Boys front man Stiv Bator, original Damned guitarist Brian James, bass player Dave Tregunna and Nicky Turner on drums - this band was pretty much the ultimate punk supergroup.The Lords debut album sound still remains fairly unique, especially the way the album was mixed with heavy reverb and compression that gives many tracks a sort of gothic surf guitar vibe.  Like a few other great punk bands that (at least appeared to be) in it for the long haul like The Clash, The Lords took the simple, raw hate stare of punk and refined and matured that sound and style without losing the genre's basic appeal.  They touch on many influences, from The New York Dolls to Jim Morrison to Apocalypse Now backed by the tribal, Killing Joke-esque drumming of Turner, the clear, clean bass of Tregunna and James' chiming, sharp guitar.  Fronted by Bator's snarling, acerbic vox, as said in Scott Schinder's essay on the band in the booklet, this is the band's defining statement.The minor downside of this release is there's no extra tracks such as relevant B-sides (Young Dont Cry, Girls Girls Girls) or the pre-album single versions of Livin' On Livin' and New Church included.  The 2003 Track Records release at least included the two B-Sides.Otherwise, this release sounds very much like the older Track Records remaster, however the big plus is the new liner notes and graphic layout of the booklet which includes several images of the various 7&#34; single sleeves and a few nice photos of the band from the era the album was recorded.  Like the other 2 Real Gone Music reissues, the tray graphic includes the alternate UK album cover.If you are a first time buyer of this or the other 2 Lords albums newly released by Real Gone Music, I highly recommend all three albums and this one is the by far the best of their studio releases.  I give this one my highest score because it is a genuine classic of the genre despite the fact it is a no frills release.  This one will appeal most to those listeners interested in the old school Damned/Goth/Punk style that the band members came from.",5.0,2013 Reissue of Classic Lords Debut Album,1385078400.0,"11 22, 2013"

A2UBS120XE605X,B00005V63C,Frank Paris,"[2, 2]","It can be terrifying installing new hardware and drivers on a PC and it was for me with the Yamaha CRW3200FXZ, but the terror was short-lived and it seems to be behaving itself. I bought this drive because the specs seemed to be superior to drives that have even faster write rates (up to 40X -- this one is 24X). I'd heard that 24X drives can achieve writing a full 700 MByte disk in 5 minutes. Well this one does it in 4 and for that it is worth five stars for me, but a few nits and my ""terrifying"" experience with it cause me to downgrade it to four stars.First, the terrifying experience, caused by a bug in the driver. The enclosed Firewire cable that comes with the unit is a mere 27 inches long (pretty useless), so I had set it up on the floor (the only place it would reach the back of my PC). Then I cut 11 700 MByte disks (all different) without a hitch, and I was surprised and extremely delighted by the 4 minute burn time for each disk. My previous CD burner was SCSI and rated 12X yet it took a half hour to burn each disk (albeit on a slower machine). So I couldn't be happier about this speed, the very reason I bought this to begin with.Then I went out and bought a six foot Firewire cable and had to disconnect everything to re-position the unit. To my annoyance, the unit did NOT automatically reconnect like Firewire devices are supposed to. So I rebooted my machine without plugging in the Firewire cable and as soon as the CRW3200FXZ driver announced its presence, to my horror, Windows 2000 crashed with the infamous blue-screen! I rebooted twice more and got the same blue screen crash. Out of desperation, before my fourth attempt, I hooked up all cables and rebooted again. To my great relief, everything booted up properly and the unit was once again fully functional. Now I'm afraid to turn it off! But the driver packaged with my unit was obviously buggy, which is one reason I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars. I haven't yet checked the Yamaha website to see if there is an update.A nit that I have with the packaging is the outrageously bright LED sitting on the front of the unit. You know those exceedingly bright LEDs that have been recently developed that they now put in headlamps and flashlights? Yamaha is using one of those on the front of their device! It's so bright when a disk is not in the unit (a bright violet) that you can't even look at it and it puts a purple glow in my entire bedroom at night! With a disk in place a not quite so bright (but still too bright) blue light emanates from that same LED. Yamaha should have used a standard LED, which is all you need.The burn software that comes with the Yamaha for free I like better than the best-selling commercial product. I have just two complaints. To start a new job, you have to go through a wizard every time which requires four quick clicks of the mouse to run through it. Fortunately it remembers all its settings from one execution to the next, so it is only a minor complaint. What is superior about this software is the progress status it gives while writing the disk: everything you would want and more. The only thing I don't like about it (besides the wizard) is that it doesn't give you the exact byte count on the main dialog when you prepare the job. You have to go fishing for it inside the menu system. I had one disk that was right on the border of 700 MBytes (according to the progress bar) but I decided to let it rip anyhow. After grinding away for four minutes, it gave me an error indicating that the disk was unwritable! So I tried again and got the same thing. I decided to test this one and saw that I could read everything on the disk. Apparently there wasn't enough room on the disk to write some terminating status or something. But the disk was good!So some minor complaints and a few minutes of terror. Other than that, the unit seems to be well designed (except get rid of the torch of an LED!) and it's blazing fast for its 24X rating.",4.0,"Great intrinsic design and fast, but had scary problems",1033171200.0,"09 28, 2002"

After reviewing book 1 in this series I fell in love with the characters and was eagerly anticipating the next story.Chloe and Scotty fit perfectly together, these two characters are written so that as a reader we feel we&#8217;re on a journey with them. The fact that I am so drawn not only to the characters but also the game of Baseball has truly surprised me.Pamela Aares has a wonderful way in her writing of making the reader look at certain things in a whole new way.

A18TSDA9ZRLKVM,B00269DX5W,"Robert S. ""geek hipster""","[11, 17]","The first Assassins Creed is notorious in it's reputation. Alot of people felt it was a nice tech demo for graphics, but otherwise it just a platformer game with a few simple objectives that went on way too long.  I agreed, but still enjoyed it, and was curious to get through to the end to find out where the story was going.I was a mollified to see that in the interest of making a larger game, the graphics in 2 have been simplified to run more smoothly. AC2 is full of blurred edges and textures and a muddy color palette. The shadows are blocky, and don't move realistically (especially on faces in some closeups). Character models show some weird artifacts. Distances are flattened in a perpetual haze. One thing I really loved about AC1 was how you could stop and look at any street and appreciate all the fine detail. Not so here.  There ARE more people types in the street in AC2, but otherwise this is a graphical downgrade that seems to want to conjure up comparisons to an oil paint 'look'. AC1 may have had hiccups and slowdown, but it 'popped' and looked alot cleaner on my hi-def TV than this.The gameplay... might be a matter of taste.  If you wanted more step & fetch, this game has it.  You'll do alot more running back and forth, getting letters, documents, delivering boxes, carrying bodies, beating up philandering boyfriends, following people, etc. Having to manually follow someone who you are having a conversation with was a little weird. There is also the addition of an ingame economy, so you can now rob dead people, pickpocket, buy paintings, change the color of your clothing, repair your armor and weapons, hire prostitutes to lure guards (fun!), throw money in the street to draw a crowd... Point to point races against local couriers will challenge your ability to find the quickest route across the rooftops and pray Ezio doesn't 'stick' to the wrong surface. Simple Puzzle segments scattered throughout the game world will illuminate more of the games backstory.  A notoriety 'system' will force you to remove wanted posters (never on the street, always on second story balconies, for some reason) and kill local police. Visit Leonardo Da Vinci who will create weaponry for you if you have the right design sketches and later unlock a nice flying mission...The core experience of the game hasn't changed at all, though. The running over rooftops is still a breeze (unless you're on a clock), and the combat is workable and fun, though the context sensitive scheme will occasionally frustrate, BUT - just like AC1, you don't ever get to perform a stealth kill on any of the games main-story targets... you track them, listen to a speech, run them down, run them through in front of a huge crowd, and then run like hell as dozens of screaming guards chase after you. It's hardly stealthy and you've done this already.The story? You're the lusty son of a proud nobleman, wronged by a conspiracy involving the Assassins and the Templars, and nothing is what it seems bla bla bla etc... I will give that Ezio is a little more likable than Alta'ir of the first game.. but it didn't make me care about him or his family, or what was going on, and Desmond simply switching teams to be exploited by Lucy and her friends instead of the evil Abstergo Company  didn't impress me much, either. I thought Desmond was a dullard in the first game, but the Holy Land story was more crackling than this.  AC2's story gets lost in the volume of chores you have to do very quickly.If you didn't like the first game, there's no way I would recommend this.",2.0,"Surprisingly, No Taxi Missions",1259366400.0,"11 28, 2009"
A2UN4S3N7VYLEV,0099740915,Charles E. Stevens,"[1, 1]","This was my first experience with Margaret Atwood, and based on my enjoyment of this book it will not be my last.  The pacing was deliberate, thoughtful, and yet still suspenseful in a way that reminded me of Ursula Le Guin; the oppressive, big brother, totalitarian aspect reminded me quite a bit of George Orwell.  Those are two of my favorite authors, so perhaps it is no surprise that this book worked for me.It was interesting to read that Atwood says she writes ""speculative fiction"" rather than ""science fiction"", a distinction I call interesting because it calls to mind Le Guin's excellent introduction to her novel ""Left Hand of Darkness"" where she states (correctly, I believe) that (good) science fiction is descriptive, not speculative.  In other words, no one has a crystal ball, and trying to guess what the world will be like tomorrow let alone a decade, century, or millennium from now is not the job of a fiction writer.  While there are, by necessity, speculative elements in any science fiction work, the main goal of the author is to use that setting to tell a story about events happening now.  In other words, while a science fiction story might contain monsters and spaceships, it is not *about* monsters and spaceships.  To me, this is where The Handmaid's Tale shines ... not necessarily a predictor of what the world (or the U.S. specifically) will be like in the near future, but rather as a metaphor for important current issues such as gender relations, age relations, tying the value of women to marriage and children, the objectification of historical events and individuals (I'm thinking of the epilogue), religion, voice vs. silence, etc., etc. ... issues no less important today than when Atwood penned this tale thirty years ago.  Some of these issues have become much more subtle and implicit than in the '80s in the U.S. and Canada, and remain much more explicit and overt elsewhere, but are universally important (and will likely remain so for centuries to come).I loved Atwood's writing style as well.  I've seen words such as ""slow"" and ""confusing"" used to describe this book in some of the less favorable reviews here, but I think for someone who takes the time to truly read and think about the tale this will not be the case.  The blending of past and present, the paranoia and moments close to madness, this is all what one would expect from a prisoner trapped in an Orwellian universe.  I liked how there is a slow reveal of the world the protagonist is forced to live in ... the book becomes all the more chilling and suspenseful--and thought-provoking--the more details are filled in.Obviously not for everyone, but for me I thought this was an outstanding read.  If you're looking for light reading or an action-driven story, this is not the book for you.

The first design mistake I noticed was that they moved all of the attachments to the bottom back! Terrible idea! You have to bend to remove and replace the attachments every time you use them. The previous design had them under a plastic lid in the top front where they were readily accessible. For me this was a better design as I never used the (useless) brush attachment that they have mounted in the top front now. Suction is good for pet hair and small crumbs but this vaccuum is terrible at sucking up small things like cheerios or mini-M&M's. You literally have to go over them 10 times before they get sucked up. The other disappointing thing about this model is how cheap the tubes are.

The 11 tracks are mostly Rock & Roll raveups, with catchy sing along choruses that stick in your head.  Their last album, the excellent ""Brothers"" combined this approach along with soulful ballads and midtempo tracks.  This time around they are aiming for the rafters with a consise and focused album, which is also their most commercial album to date.  But this is not a bad thing, as they have not sacrificed any of the clever lyrics and great melodies that have put them at the forefront of current Rock & Roll.  The soul influence is also firmly intact with the 'Motown meets Spector' Danger Mouse touch on songs like ""Dead & Gone"" and ""Sister"", and the classic ""Stop Stop"".  Songs like these balance the albums anthemic ravers. The Rock & Roll ravers are the real meat and heart of this great album.  ""Lonely Boy"", ""Money Maker"" and especially ""Gold On The Ceiling"" are lighter-raising classics of the highest order.  I mean, how many bands are making Rock & Roll party records like this anymore?Producer Danger Mouse has managed to keep the grit and edge on this record.  My only complaint (and it's minor) is he murks up Dan Auerbach's vocals on too many tracks.  What he does do brillantly is coax many tones and shades from Dan's guitar. Patrick Carney's drums are at times snappy, then thunderingly loud, but solid as rock throughout.  I think Danger Mouse is looking to create his own Wall Of Sound, and The Keys are the perfect band to realise this vision with.  Hopefully their collaboration will continue.The vinyl pressing is excellent, and the inclusion of the CD is very nice.  Like their last album, it comes with a cool poster.

Always leave your shoes on.&#8221;&#8230;and that&#8217;s just the beginning of how hot this story gets.Stephanie Bradford is thriving in her career, but life at home with her husband, Jacob, has grown stale. Her attempts to reignite the spark have failed. Her frustration is at an all time high when the charming, dynamic, and sexy-as-hell Derrick enters her life. He offers her all she&#8217;s been craving from her husband....desire, passion, kink. Stephanie gives into temptation, taking her life out of control on a twisted path full of passion, betrayal, tragedy, and mystery.I think a lot of readers can relate to the way Stephanie feels in the beginning of this book. Bryan paints a picture of challenges many face in their marriages. People get comfortable, fall into routines, and although the love remains, the fire fades. Stephanie longs to feel sexy and desirable; she wants the excitement, the heat, and the lust. Her encounter with Derrick incites all of those feelings in her. It&#8217;s when Stephanie acts on those feelings that the story takes us on an unpredictable journey.I loved the unpredictability of the plot. I find myself saying this a lot, but I am thrilled when a book surprises me. Bryan reminds us that you never know what a person is capable of&#8230;how much a person can love another or what sinister tendencies someone has hidden inside.

Hilarity and chaotic/exciting moments ensue...Generally speaking it's a fun book to read if you're a fan of the vampire/supernatural genre. There are a few technical problems here and there but as long as you try not to take those things too seriously and you'll be fine.For example, there are places where there exists large, multi-paragraph descriptions, devoted to the observation of a single thing. All the while, the characters do nothing but stare blankly at said thing.  To those of you who have watched the TV show ""The Wonder Years"", you know what I'm talking about. There were occasions when characters stared blankly at objects and said nothing. They just kept thinking their inner monologue. Personally, there were times I imagined how weird that looked, to stand in a room where two main characters just stare at each other for an extended length of time, and have nothing happen. Just looking... and looking... and looking... But, that's just me. You can skim those paragraphs if they get too long, and you'll still be ok.This story works fine as a stand alone book.

In this book though, I never felt like there were any obligatory cameos at all. The book's female protagonist did have a large family (The Argeneau Family), the members of which, I asume, are each the subject of their own books in the line. They all had different personalities, but since they had the same goal, in the end, memorizing every name and motivation wasn't an issue, so I never felt lost or confused.There's a vampire hunter sub-plot. It was ok. It did what it had to, and didn't get in the way of the romance, the latter, of course, being the important bit.There was one rather large large plot that never gets resolved at the end, which kind of bothered me. The author did that thing where the book simply goes: It will get resolved in the future, even though you don't read about it here, or anywhere else, it will get resolved, trust me. The end.That being said, as long as you read this book as the tale of a kind hearted vampire with issues and a psychiatrist who finds himself falling for her, you'll be fine.

There was still that air of paranormal, but it was focused more on the love, the past, and the reuniting of two people.

I think the author did an amazing job pulling at the reader's heart, allowing them to fully enter into the character's lives.  I felt terrible for Jack and Sarah, and the love that was not allowed to bloom.  But there is a certain comfort that comes at the end, so there is that.Great job!

As a result, this album was poorly promoted by the record label, whose corporate officers were engaged in a boardroom war to choose a leader of the company that did not end until mid-1994. The label from 1991-1993 was chaired by Bob Krasnow, Anita Baker, and Natalie Cole, thus making the label very chaotic. When a final leader, Sylvia Rhone, was chosen, she set out to remove all 80's bands from the label by bankrupting them, thus hurting Malmsteen's career.[citation needed]The album was to be Malmsteen's last major commercial outing. It was his third and last attempt (starting with 1988's Odyssey on Polydor) at scoring a hit album with late 80's/early 90's American glam metal audience. The album, apart from the song ""Teaser"", however, was more closely rooted in neo-classical metal than any album he'd done since 1986's Trilogy (also on Polydor). It featured three stunning neo-classical instrumentals, as well as several good neo-classical metal pieces. Being a more commercial album, it featured bright, clear production as well, which is still credited by fans to this day.I'm just experiencing a wave of nostalgia. I thought this album was way underrated.A great Yngwie album just like Wikepedia says.Also as a footnote, the early 90's became the era of grunge metal and all the 80's bands including Yngwie were just old hat - all of a sudden - grunge is all over the magazine covers but diehard fans don't forget. Point being that there's nothing wrong with Yngwie in the 90's - he was just off the fashion radar. Yngwie's fall from popularity wasn't due to the more ""commercial"" albums like ""Odyssey"" or ""Eclipse"" but to the rise of ""Grunge"" (the horror, the unspeakable horror).",5.0,Classic Yngwie Material,1291507200.0,"12 5, 2010"

It lets him view the activities of the unsuspecting person. He and Steph are also able to communicate mentally, and it is this unique, but secret talent which has helped them bring criminals to justice, as they assist the local sheriff when he asks for help.Unfortunately, there are other persons possessing this rare gift.Their sole purpose is to do evil and destroy everyone in their way, including Steph and Chris. The Campbells are also in debt, and have a very rich and powerful enemy, who will do anything devious to get them  to sell their farm.Kevin Hallock was in his element when he wrote Eye Spy.

I can now hook onto the bar with the hooks no matter what kind it is (olympic bars, machine bars, etc) and pull with my elbows to really get that back contraction in the upper to middle of my back without having to worry about my grip or letting my biceps do a lot or any of the work!! I can even hold it the squeeze for 2 seconds with my hands in a &#34;loose grip&#34; and that will get your back feeling like its on fire in all the places you want!!The HHooks are also well made as I put them through hell, every workout, plus the fit is good without cutting off circulation!! Another think I like about this product is the strap comes straight out not at an angle or from the side in like other wrist straps which to me makes the grip more secure without any stress felt on the wrists like the standard wrist straps.All in all, these Haulin Hooks are working better than even I expected and I would give them an A+ not just an A cuz my back in the 2.5 months I have been using these HHooks my back has grown thicker/wider than ever before.

Straps snuggly in place and narrow across the back for tearing through brush and occasional climbing without restricting movement. The back padding and shoulder straps keeps it comfortably worn even after a long hike day. The straps allow it to be removed and put on and snugged down quickly and easily. It's a well thought out design with only a few modifications I would upgrade. I'm not sure what moisture the Vapel mesh Airflow padded back wicks away, not where it wicks it to. But after a long hot hike, the  back of my shirt is excessively, dripping wet. On the contrary, It almost  seems to restrict air flow and retain moisture. I did get the Black one, so perhaps that contributes to the retention. And, I don't hike, not to sweat. The function of the air flow feature seem to be geared more toward Bike riders, when used at a more horizontal angle for air flow to be forced through.  I really like the idea of carrying two liters of nice iced water on demand. But again, I would modify a few features. Although the 2 liter water reservoir is easy to fill and clean, it is tricky to remove and install from and to its compartment. The holding snap opens hardly wide enough to accept the bag handle. The nice Black insulated foam tube sheathing might come in handy for preventing water delivery from freezing, but on hot days in can really heat up the first flow of water. Maybe if it were able to be removed and replaced? Also, the hands free- bite to activate nozzle is a bit to get used to. If slightly damaged in an attempt to function, it drips a very cool stream of water down your warmed up body. The nozzle did come with a temporary cellophane cover to keep it clean during shipping. But I have installed a pop on cap. I noticed other hikers dragging their exposed nozzle across anything and everything we came across from dust to poison oak. Nothing of which I'd prefer in my mouth.

I cut the ends of the cable off and directly wired the cable strands to the ethernet jack. Surprise surprise, this cable is cheap. But, that's pretty much what I expected for only 8 bucks.1) Not twisted pair cable, which means this isn't 'real' cat 5e...2) The gauges of the individual wires inside the cable were different. The Black wire was the biggest, the striped blue/green strands were significantly smaller diameter.3) As a result of (2), several strand colors did not work with punch-down ethernet jacks. The punch-down keystone wall jack has little blades that are supposed to cut through the wire insulation and make electrical contact with the wire. Well, some of the strand wires were too thin for the punch to cut through, and they ended up just mashing the insulation. I had to strip those wire strands and solder it directly to the jack.So, as a patch cable (i.e. plugging it in on both ends), this cable performs as expected. If you try to do more than that (like I did), you're in for a world of headaches. I won't hold the cable accountable for my problems (because I went beyond what this cable was meant to do), but minus a star for not being twisted-pair cat 5e. All cat 5 cable should be twisted pair.

Yes, I realize that they want this usable by both right- and left-handed people, but I have used other ambidextrous scissors that are much better.Details: I can fit only two fingers comfortably inside the handles.  If I use my index and middle fingers, the extremely poor fit of the other handle to the thumb is not just uncomfortable, but severely limits how far I can open the blades and how much cutting force I can generate with a natural motion.What I have settled on is having the middle and ring fingers inside the handle.  It seems _very_ strange having the index finger in front of the handle, but it allows adequate motion of the blades and allows me to generate enough force to cut medium chicken bones.With this grip, my little finger does not quite fit inside the handle, but having it outside puts too much space between it and the ring finger and thus feels ""unnatural"".

His extended family has gathered to pay their last respects while the media also arrives seeking a story especially since his two famous sisters have publicly feuded over him in the past fifteen years.The gathering is mindful of a similar family meeting that happened a decade and a half earlier to discuss how to handle the scandal.  On the front page of the newspaper is an accusation that Henry is having an affair with his parishioner Elizabeth Tilton witnessed by her children.  A church committee conducts a kangaroo hearing into the matter and in 1875, he stands trial for committing adultery while his former parishioner, Theodore Tilton, sues him.  Henry's sisters split as Harriet the renowned author supports him and Isabelle the ardent suffragette condemns her sibling.This is a fabulous historical fiction tale that could be easily read in the headlines of today.  Other flashbacks round out the tale, but it is the deftly handled celebrity trial of Henry Ward Beecher that makes this worth reading.

This book appeals to a wide variety of readers, it is written in way that doesn't scare off newbies, but manages to have enough meat for experienced Linux users. The great thing about this book is it spends a fair amount of time explaining how to do things on a variety of distros.Parts of the book that stand out in my mind are the chapters dealing with kernel recompilation, scripting and security. The kernel recompilation chapter is by far the best material I've seen on the subject to date, it almost makes kernel recompilation sound too easy. The security chapter is good starting point for sysadmins that are new to Linux. The book also provides a nice little introduction to scripting, although if your going to be a Linux sysadmin, the Orielly books on bash and perl are a must.There were very few things that I didn't like about this book. One thing that stands out in my mind is the author's insistence on using paper journal books for logging system changes. With the proper backup procedures in place, a web based system log is a much more efficient way of keeping tracking of changes. Overall, the book is must read for anyone new to Linux and is also a good pickup for seasoned Linux users.

Gomez,"[2, 2]","I don't know if it's just the one that I have but I am a semi-pro photographer who bought this and never really used it until I was in a bind where my other bag was being used by a friend so I pulled out this one. For the price, it's not bad I guess but I was disappointed in what happened after 1 day of use. Basically I took this bag with me to the Zoo where I was photographing a child's birthday party. I had a few lenses in there and my Canon 5d mark III which I primarily carried myself because I was shooting so much. This bag was by no means overfilled with gear. I had 2 other lenses and a flash. Other than that I had a few CF memory cards and batteries and that's it. Long story short, I used it for about 6 hours and before this day, I had NEVER used it before. This bag was on my back the entire time. It did not get dropped, snagged or scuffed on anything. A zipper did come off by itself during the middle of the day but that didn't really bother me because I knew that at the $30-$40 price point, they wouldn't be using high quality zippers.Long story short, I got home and sat my bag down and noticed a huge tear in both front end pockets. FAIL!!! Keep in mind I only used it once and for 6 hours tops. I was very disappointed that it ripped so easily. I could understand if I was packing a whole bunch of gear but I had a 24-70, 16-35 and a 50mm in the bag with a few CF cards and batteries. That's it. No tripod and I carried my 5D Mark III on me. Other than the breaking zipper and the tears, this bag does have a few slight design flaws that Canon could improve on. The first being that at the top of the bag, there isn't enough felt for the velcro to attach to which makes it difficult to rearrange this bag to keep everything safe and well cushioned. The bag could use more cushion while I'm on that subject but again, it's such a cheap bag you can't really expect Grade A materials. I gave it 2 stars because the cheap price point saves it from getting 1 star. I'll stick with my Think Tank bag from now on.",2.0,You get what you pay for,1346630400.0,"09 3, 2012"

The Jack Elliott/Victor Young ballad, ""Weaver of Dreams"" features some tender horn work from Hubbard while the Wayner Shorter-penned ""Marie Antoinette"" is a quirky, bouncy, mid-tempo showcase for the soloists.Tyner, drummer Elvin Jones and bass player Art Davis were in the midst of their tenure with Coltrane when this album was made and they display a deep simpatico throughout.

Despite great reviews on several legit treadmill rating sites, I almost didn't order b/c of some scathing reviews on Amazon about delivery & customer service.  BTW, I have no invested interest in Smooth or any other treadmill company.  I'm in academics.  Anyhow, I ordered on Wed. or Thursday of last week & it arrived Monday.  Had I been home, I could have had it on Saturday.  I had free shipping to the front door & the 2 guys they sent were great.  The treadmill came in 2 boxes; one big, but light.  The other was so ridiculously heavy I couldn't manage to budge it at all, and I'm a fairly strong woman.  Fortunately, my son has a buddy in the moving business.  He & his brother got it downstairs. Unbox it first.  You can separate out some parts & reduce both weight & dimensions.  Unless you have access to at least 2 really strong men, pay for the room delivery.  The delivery men did tell me that the ""white glove"" service (delivery to room & set up) is a waste of money.  They are only alloted 1/2 hr, which is often not enough.  Then you pay an hourly rate or they leave. He also said that they deliver numerous treadmills of all kinds every day & they don't really have any expertise in setting up any one model.  I think his exact words were ""we don't know what we are doing"".  That said, my husband & I set it up easily last night.  I'll echo a previous reviewer & state that it's crucial you 1) don't pinch the wires going through the right post and 2) HAND TIGHTEN ONLY the screws during the initial set up.  You get a chance to tighten them all later.  I works best to get all the screws in, tightened just enough to keep them from falling out.  GENTLY jiggle the console (you need 2 to put it on, but it's not heavy)to get the screws started.  They strip easily, so don't force anything.  Once all are in, tighten each one a little at a time, then go around & tighten a little more.  Repeat until they are all fully hand tight. The treadmill is nice, although I wish it had an internal fan. The decals are a little cheesy (very clearly decals)but that's just cosmetic.

AOEAD7DPLZE53,B004JISIE4,NLee the Engineer,"[73, 73]","I purchased thisSandisk 32GB MicroSDHC Class 4  Memory Cardover one month ago, for use in myVIZIO 8-Inch Tablet VTAB1008. At the same time, I also purchased a higher-pricedPNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)which is supposed to be a 'class-10'. My benchmark results, however, show that the Sandisk class-4 card is actually faster - most of the time.I used two sets of benchmark programs. One is called 'Flash Memory Toolkit v2.0', which measures the random read/write speed of files between 1MB and 15MB. The other one is called 'H2testw v1.4', which measures the sequential read/write speed using 1GB files. Here are my results: (see my uploaded charts in 'Customer Images' section for details)- For smaller files (1-5MB), the Sandisk class-4 card gives an amazing write speed of 15-17MB/s, while the PNY 'class-10' card can only get 1-6MB/s- For larger files (10-15MB), the Sandisk and PNY cards are about equal at around 8MB/s for write- For huge files (1GB), the PNY did better at 9.5MB/S, while the Sandisk dropped to 5.5MB/s- The read speeds of both cards are equally high at around 18MB/S (this number may be limited by the maximum speed of my card reader used)What the above shows is that: When used in a typical digital camera (with file size 3-5MB), this Sandisk 'class-4' card is at least twice as fast as the PNY so-called 'class-10' card. But when used in a HD video camera (sequential writing of huge file), then the PNY card should perform better.For a card to be marketed as a 'class-10', it must maintain a MINIMUM write speed of 10MB/s. So by this definition, the PNY card does not qualify since it cannot even achieve a MAXIMUM write speed of 10MB/s. This Sandisk card, on the other hand, exceeds the requirement of 'class-4' by a huge margin.Sandisk seems to be the only flash memeory manufacturer that still gives honest, conservative speed class ratings. Any other manufacturers would have labeled this card a 'class-6' or even higher. As a matter of principle, I rather give my money to a company that promises less but delivers more, instead of to others that do the opposite.The only problem with this package is that: the includedSandisk MicroMate USB Card Reader (SDDR-121-GREY)does not work at all. I tested it with differet micro-SD/SDHC cards on three different computers. They all can recognize the drive, but not the memory card inside. Minus one star for that.[Update on Oct 26, 2013]It turns out that the Sandisk MicroMate USB card reader is working. I just need to push the microSDHC card in a little further, until I hear a 'click'. Its speed is typical for an USB 2.0 card reader. Added back one star.[Update Nov 19, 2013]The Sandisk card is still working fine after two years in my tablet. It should be noted that I have purchased dozens of CF/SD/microSD cards over the past decade, and only experienced ONE card failure (which was caused by an incompatable card reader). So I'm probably just more careful in handling memory cards. For example, I always make sure to discharge myself electrically before touching a card to avoid ESD zap, and use ""Safely Eject USB Device"" command to remove a card.",5.0,This Sandisk 'class-4' micro-SDHC card is faster than a PNY 'class-10',1321833600.0,"11 21, 2011"

I read it so much that I asked for (and received) an unabridged copy of it for Christmas in 1967.  I have read that book at least 15 times over the years since then.  I loved Alexander Dumas' other books, too--at least half a dozen of them.  This very love of the characters in ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and appreciation of the author's other works is what made me wish that I had never heard of this book.  It soured my pleasure of his talents.  Less than 10% of the book is actually about Edmond Dantes or his private life after he left with Haydee.  The rest is the story of the ""republican"" or ""communist"" revolution that finally overthrew the French monarchy for good.  It's not just that it's juvenile in its presentation (and I like history), it strains to include Edmond as a player and gratuitously throws in a little to make you feel as if it actually is telling you about life after vengeance.  Much of the book consists of characters sitting around talking about what happened/is happening/will happen.  You aren't there.  I have a rule which I have broken only once: if I start a book, I finish it.  This would have been the second book that I broke that rule on if I hadn't been rooting for a some redeeming quality up to the very end.  This book stinks on ice.

A3GWYO69U107WB,1938499921,jmn89,"[2, 3]","I received a free copy of this book from the author through a Goodreads giveaway.I thought this book was okay, but not fantastic.  I'm not a fan of Christian fiction usually, it seems that in most Christian fiction the God aspect is so forced and stilted.  This is not the case in this story.  Though that was still a little heavy handed for my taste, it was not overpowering.I do love historical fiction, and the Revolutionary War is a subject that I find very interesting.  Cooper did an excellent job of describing what a battle (because the book only really covers the span of time of one battle) was like.  She did a good job of building up to the battle, and I did feel very &#34;in&#34; the story at times.  I also like that the book was inspired by real people, and that the house is still standing.The writing itself was fairly good.  It flowed well, and I could follow the story easily for the most part.  My complaint with the writing was that there was not enough development.  There were a couple of things that really bothered me throughout: Betsy has a brother and sister-in-law that are only loosely referred to, but are somewhat imperative to the story.  It took me quite a while to realize that Josiah's parents were not present.  Also, Amos is mentioned a few times, and he seems like he should be important to Betsy's state of mind, but there's never a real explanation of who he is or what happened to him, besides a very brief and unsatisfying sentence or two.  I personally felt that the characters could have been fleshed out some more.  I rarely say this, but I honestly feel that this book could have been better if it was longer.Overall, this book was a quick and easy read; good for people who enjoy historical Christian fiction.

Suspenseful right? We have plot twists that will have your head spinning! She also gives us two budding romance stories not just one, which I thought was very well done. We have two couples that play an important role in this story the main couple is Jax and Raven. The heat between them is scorching! He is a man that is used to getting what he wants no questions asked but finds himself chasing after the one person that has turned his life upside down. Raven is a woman with a past that has made allusive with a tendency to run when things get to close of to heavy, but Jax if having none of it.When Jax decides that they will be a couple Raven has no choice but to give into her desires and see where this will take them. Being in the spotlight becomes an issue when both of their pasts come to destroy what they are desperately trying to build. Now let's talk about the heat level this couple share. I do believe I said it was scorching and I mean blazing, scorching HOT! Jax has dominating tendencies and enacts them frequently taking raven to new heights. Try to be in a comfortable, cool spot as your are reading because Jax will have you squirming.Now the second budding romance that we have in this book is Jackie and Max. max is Jax's body guard and best friend, Jackie is best friends with Raven. When the two of them meet they have an instant attraction that neither of them want to act on. Why? Well Max does not do relationships and Jackie has never been in one. but they can't fight the attraction they have towards one another and when they finally decide to come together their union is beautiful! But nothing in this book is easy and you will find that poor Jackie must suffer for the man that she has fallen in love with. What does that mean?

I've read about the scientifically most agreeable level of pH in water before, but I had never tried any of it until now.Having had jugged tap water until I was blue in the face that hot workday, I figured there would be no better time to try my Essentia once I got home and I was all watered-out.

That's what it takes to achieve the perfect pH that makes it so easy to glide through all six servings these 1.5 liter bottles provide.

Corn ""reviewer""","[2, 2]","I was riveted by this book, especially by the contrast between Dominick's mother and Edie Kramer, who is a mistress/lover to Dominick's father. Dominick, torn between his loyalty to his mother and his unexpected, but strong passion for Edie, makes some decisions that result in heartbbreak for those around him. The resentment and anger he feels toward his father, who runs off for days at a time, goes on drinking binges and is unfaithful to his wife, is so well-written that it was painful to read at points, almost too realistic, if that is possible.  If this book sounds a bit soap opera-ish, believe me, it isn't. The author has a way of making the reader feel that Dominick's conflicting feelings are understandable and that he can feel both love for his mother and a yearning for Edie Kramer, who is sexy and seductive, and whose passionate nature excudes a strong power over a young boy. And Edie doesn't hesitate to use her allure to her advantage, when she realizes Dominick is attracted to her.  I have one criticism of this book. I wish the author had made the book even longer, added more detail about Dominick's emotions and those of his mother, father and others. I did feel as though there were several parts in the book where there would be a sudden decision or crisis without the actions or descriptions that made these fully understandable. Perhaps this was intentional but I still would have liked even more detail than provided.  Even so, this is a strong debut novel by a talented writer. The contrast between Edie Kramer and Dominick's mother, their different personalities, attitudes towards life and family, was fascinating to me. Dominick, too, is a compelling person, a teen trying to make a place for himself in spite of a difficult and challenging life.

AE07VPT4R6VX4,B00ET9XQQ8,Tracy,"[34, 34]","What attracted me to this phone most were two things; the size and android (also the price).  I needed a phone that I could keep in my pocket (with a case on it) and not feel like I'm carrying a tablet in there.  I used to have a blackberry curve 9360, and I loved the size of the phone and the QWERTY keyboard, but Blackberry just doesn't have much for apps, and they are slowly losing app support from google.  Also they don't do activesync email which was a problem for my work.  I couldn't find any other android phones (that work with Tmobile) in this size category (similar to an iphone size).The performance of this phone is very fast for day to day use (I'm not a gamer), and of course Android is awesome.  I will say that with the smaller screen it is more difficult to type than on my wife's Galaxy SII (I would assume this is the same with Iphones too), but with the auto-correct or SWYPE, it really isn't that bad.  I'm getting faster at typing on it.  The phone does feel ""cheap"", but that really is just because it is so small and so light (relative to other android devices).  Put a case on it and it feels great, I've got big hands and it still fits well.  The screen is very nice.The camera is normal, nothing to write home about it.  For me it gets the job done.  With the addition of an SD card I have no issues with the small amount of memory available.  If you're super paranoid about running out of application memory the phone can be rooted and you have options for storing apps on the SD card.  My wife's samsung came with much more bloatware than LG put on this guy, so no complaints there.All in all I'm very happy with the purchase, especially for $199.Update 9/23/2013After having this phone for a few weeks, I love it even more.  It really is fast, the LTE is blazing fast when I have it, and the battery lasts forever.  I love the smaller size of this phone, and have completely gotten used to typing on it normally, and with Swype typing (and I have big hands and fingers).  There is definitely a bug with Swype with the stock LG keyboard (noted in other LG phone reviews) where it deletes the second word every time, but I just downloaded the google keyboard, and it works awesome.  Not sure what other people want that this phone doesn't have, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

Parts ran me $275 for 3/4 copper, 3/4 black iron, and 1 complete electrical circuit at Lowes.  Install completed in 1 weekend.  First 4 days of use was lousy.  The unit would shut off during showers.  Cold water pisses me off!  Shut off the shower water, then restart shower and unit would kick on again but only for 30-45 seconds.  Maddening.  Was convinced the newly installed propane tank system pressure was too low.  Called the propane company while standing in front of the unit and they agreed to come out and check their line pressure the next day.  After hanging up I thought to reboot the system so I shut it off, unplugged it, then turned it back on.  PROBLEM ALL FIXED with a reboot!  Next day the propane company came and found that the secondary regulator was malfunctioning.  Apparently the unit, with a reboot, adapted to low pressure and fixed itself.  After the pressure was adjusted I came home, did another reboot, and the unit has performed flawlessly since then.  I am surprised at the amount of water within the propane that collects in the bucket on the floor.  1.5 gallons in 45 days.  Setting at 140* was crazy hot, at 125* is plenty hot for most purposes.

My only regret is that there isn't some type of plastic coating on the cover, but that just makes it nicer for reading on the couch, or in bed.
